In this lesson we'll learn the how to implement Trend Analysis in R.

# Additional packages needed
 
To run the code in M11_Lesson_03.Rmd you may need additional packages.

* If necessary install the followings packages.

`install.packages("tseries");`     

```{r}
library(tseries)
```


# Data

We will be generating simulated data for this lesson.

#  Trend Analysis

Trend Analysis is the practice of collecting information and attempting to spot a pattern, or trend, in the information. Typically this involves analyzing the variance for a change over time. The null hypothesis: $H_0$ is that there is no trend. Many techniques can be used to identify trends, we'll use an ARMA model again. 

#  Dickey-Fuller Test

The Dickey-Fuller Test is a test for the stationarity of a time series.   

The [Dickey-Fuller test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickey%E2%80%93Fuller_test) tests whether a unit root is present in an autoregressive model.  simple AR(1) model is
$$
y_{t}=\rho y_{t-1}+u_{t}\,
$$

where $y_{t}$ is the variable of interest, $t$ is the time index, $\rho$ is a coefficient, and $u_{t}$ is the error term. A unit root is present if $\rho = 1$. The model would be non-stationary in this case.

The regression model can be written as
$$
 \nabla y_{t}=(\rho-1)y_{t-1}+u_{t}=\delta y_{t-1}+ u_{t}\,
$$ 
where $\nabla$ is the first difference operator.

The Dickey-Fuller Test uses a specific distribution simply known as the Dickey-Fuller table to assess whether $\nabla y_{t}$ is signficant. 
 
# Trend Analysis in R

```{r}
#-----------  White noise  --------
set.seed(3333)
white_noise <- rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 3.0)
plot(white_noise,type='l',xlab='Time',main='Gaussian White Noise ACF Function')
## Fitting White noise Time series 
# plot a correlogram
acf(white_noise)
var(white_noise)
#------------- Random Walk -------------
#To simulate a random walk in R, we essentially need a cumulative sum of a white noise random series. 
set.seed(333)
random_walk <- cumsum(rnorm(100, mean = 0, sd = 3.0))
plot(random_walk,type='l',xlab='Time',main='Random Walk')
# Fitting a Random Walk 
#A good way to see if a time series follows a random walk is to compute the successive differences between terms.
acf(diff(random_walk))
#----------------------------- ARMA model  ----------------------

                               # Moving Average Model

set.seed(555)
#ACF function with coefficients 0.84 and 0.62
ma_ts1 <- arima.sim(model = list(ma = c(0.84, 0.62), sd = 1.2), n = 1000)
head(ma_ts1, n = 8)
acf(ma_ts1)
#  Autoregressive model
set.seed(5555)
ma_ts3 <- arima.sim(model = list(ar = c(0.74), sd = 1.2), n = 1000)
acf(ma_ts3)
pacf(ma_ts3)
#--------------Dickey-Fuller for stationarity -----------------------
adf.test(random_walk, alternative = "stationary")
#------------ Another unit root test : Philips-Perron test -------
PP.test(random_walk)
# ------------     Seasonal Trend Decomposition in R  --------

#The Seasonal Trend Decomposition using Loess (STL) is an algorithm that was developed 
#to help to divide up a time series into three components namely: the trend, seasonality and remainder.
nottem.stl = stl(nottem, s.window="periodic")
plot(nottem.stl)
```

# Assingment

_NOTE: It's your choice to submit EITHER Lesson 02 (ARIMA models) OR Lesson 03 (Trend Analysis) for the module Time Series Analysis._   

  Answer the following questions:   
    * Can some form of Time series analysis help in your research project to forcast a prediction?    
    * If it can apply Time series analysis to your research project? Does it help?     
    * If (and only if) you can't use some form of Time series analysis help in your research project then apply a form of Time series analysis to a data set you find at the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/)
