In this lesson we'll learn regular expressions and how to use the 'tm' package in R.


# Additional packages needed
 
To run the code in M12_Lesson_02.Rmd you may need additional packages.

* If necessary install the followings packages.

`install.packages("RTextTools");`   
`install.packages("tm");`   
`install.packages("wordcloud");` 

```{r}
library(RTextTools)
library(tm)
library(wordcloud)
```


# Data

We will be using the [Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer Dataset from UC Irvine](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)), as well as Dr Suess quotes.

# Regular Expressions and Grep

In theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) (abbreviated regex or regexp and sometimes called a rational expression) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern, mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching, i.e. "find and replace"-like operations. The concept arose in the 1950s, when the American mathematician Stephen Kleene formalized the description of a regular language, and came into common use with the Unix text processing utilities ed, an editor, and [grep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) (global regular expression print), a filter.

grep is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines matching a regular expression. Grep was originally developed for the Unix operating system, but is available today for all Unix-like systems and is built in to languages like python and Perl.

# Regular Expressions Examples

Basic regex syntax

```
.	Normally matches any character except a newline.  

When you match a pattern within parentheses, you can use any of $1, $2, ... later to refer to the previously matched pattern.	

+	Matches the preceding pattern element one or more times.  	
?	Matches the preceding pattern element zero or one times.  	
*	Matches the preceding pattern element zero or more times.  
|	Separates alternate possibilities.	 

\w	Matches an alphanumeric character, including "_";  same as [A-Za-z0-9_] in ASCII, and
[\p{Alphabetic}\p{GC=Mark}\p{GC=Decimal_Number}\p{GC=Connector_Punctuation}]  

\W	Matches a non-alphanumeric character, excluding "_";
same as [^A-Za-z0-9_] in ASCII, and
[^\p{Alphabetic}\p{GC=Mark}\p{GC=Decimal_Number}\p{GC=Connector_Punctuation}]  

\s	Matches a whitespace character,
which in ASCII are tab, line feed, form feed, carriage return, and space;  

\S	Matches anything BUT a whitespace.	 

\d	Matches a digit;
same as [0-9] in ASCII;  

\D	Matches a non-digit;

^	Matches the beginning of a line or string.	  

$	Matches the end of a line or string.	  
```

Some simple regex examples 

```
 {^[-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?$}  # Floating Point Number

{^[A-Za-z]+$}   # Only letters.

 {^[[:alpha?:]]+$} # Only letters, the Unicode way.

 {(.)\1{3}} $string {\1} result # Back References 

(\[0-9]{1,3})\.(\[0-9]{1,3})\.(\[0-9]{1,3})\.(\[0-9]{1,3}) # IP Numbers 
```

# Regular Expressions in R

# Text Mining in R (tm package)  

The main structure for managing documents in tm is a so-called Corpus, representing a collection of text
documents. Custom print() methods are available which hide the raw amount of information since displaying a lot of text can hide other data.  

## Transformations

Once we have a corpus we typically want to modify the documents in it, e.g., stemming, stopword removal,
et cetera. In tm, all this functionality is subsumed into the concept of a transformation. Transformations are
done via the tm_map() function which applies (maps) a function to all elements of the corpus.  

## Creating Term-Document Matrices

A common approach in text mining is to create a term-document matrix from a corpus. In the tm package
the classes TermDocumentMatrix and DocumentTermMatrix (depending on whether you want terms as rows and
documents as columns, or vice versa) employ sparse matrices for corpora.  

##  Functions for Term-Document Matrices

The tm package has a number of operations for Term-Document Matrices (like clustering, classifications, etc.).   

For example, given a Term-Document matrix called $tdm$

*  findFreqTerms(tdm, 5) # finds terms with all least 5 counts   
*  findAssocs(tdm, "brain", 0.8) # finds associations (i.e., terms which correlate) with at least 0.8 correlation for the term  "brain"

# Assingment

Complete the programming assignment in the text of the .Rmd file from either Lesson 01 (Text Mining Theory) OR Lesson 02 (Spectral Analysis) OR Lesson 03 (Sentiment Analysis in R). 
NOTE: It's your choice to submit EITHER Lesson 01 (Text Mining Theory) OR Lesson 02 (Spectral Analysis) OR Lesson 03 (Sentiment Analysis in R) for the module Text Mining._

Create regular expressions for the patterns below: 

* Match any of the following punctuation characters in the ASCII table:  !"#$%&'()+,  

* Create one regular expression to match all common misspellings of calendar (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_of_common_misspellings/C)

* Create one regular expression to match any character except line breaks.  

* You need to validate a ZIP code (U.S. postal code), allowing both the five-digit and nine-digit (called ZIP+4) formats. The regex should match 02115 and 02115-5515, but not 2115, 2115-5515, 21155515,021155515, etc..

* You need to validate a legit any password for your website. Passwords have the following complexity requirements: Length between 8 and 32 characters, ASCII visible and space characters only, One or more uppercase letters, One or more lowercase letters, One or more special characters (ASCII punctuation)  


* Load the file ML.Tweets.csv (it is online at  'http://nikbearbrown.com/YouTube/MachineLearning/Twitter/ML.Tweets.csv')
* Do the following:
    * Extract a list of the top 9 users (e.g. @NikBearBrown)
    * Extract a list of the top 9 hashtags (e.g. #Bear)    
    * Find the top 5 most positve tweets  
    * Find the top 5 most negative tweets  
    * Create a world cloud of 100 related tweets      
    * Which tweets could be classified as game development?   

Write up your report as an .Rmd file.
