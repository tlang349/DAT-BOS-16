In this lesson we'll learn the how to implement Time series analysis using ARIMA in R.


# Additional packages needed
 
To run the code in M11_Lesson_02.Rmd you may need additional packages.

* If necessary install the followings packages.

`install.packages("RCurl");`  
`install.packages("plyr");`  
`install.packages("forecast");`  


```{r}
library(RCurl)
library(plyr)
library(forecast)
```


# Data

We will be using is some Seismic Activity in Greece (earthquake) data from the University of Athens, Greece http://www.geophysics.geol.uoa.gr/


```{r}
data <- read.table(textConnection(getURL(
  "http://www.geophysics.geol.uoa.gr/catalog/catgr_20002008.epi")),sep = "", header = F)
#  The last two columns of data contain the surface depth and earthquake intensity.
names(data) <- c("date", "mo", "day", "hr", "mn", "sec",
                          "lat", "long", "depth", "mw")
head(data, n = 3)
```

# Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)

An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA or ARMA) model combines an autoregressive component with a moving average component in to a single model.   

An [autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA or ARMA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average) model is a generalization of an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. These models are fitted to time series data either to better understand the data or to predict future points in the series (forecasting). They are applied in some cases where data show evidence of non-stationarity, where an initial differencing step (corresponding to the "integrated" part of the model) can be applied to reduce the non-stationarity.

Non-seasonal ARIMA models are generally denoted $ARIMA(p, d, q)$ where parameters $p, d, and q$ are non-negative integers, $p$ is the order of the Autoregressive model, $d$ is the degree of differencing, and $q$ is the order of the Moving-average model.  The he number of differences $d$ is determined using repeated statistical tests. The values of $p$ and $q$ are then chosen by minimizing the AICc after differencing the data $d$ times. 

The ARIMA model uses an iterative three-stage modeling approach:

Model identification and model selection: making sure that the variables are stationary, identifying seasonality in the dependent series (seasonally differencing it if necessary), and using plots of the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions of the dependent time series to decide which (if any) autoregressive or moving average component should be used in the model.   

Parameter estimation using computation algorithms to arrive at coefficients that best fit the selected ARIMA model. The most common methods use maximum likelihood estimation or non-linear least-squares estimation.   

Model checking by testing whether the estimated model conforms to the specifications of a stationary univariate process. In particular, the residuals should be independent of each other and constant in mean and variance over time. (Plotting the mean and variance of residuals over time and performing a Ljung-Box test or plotting autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation of the residuals are helpful to identify misspecification.) If the estimation is inadequate, we have to return to step one and attempt to build a better model.   

# Time series analysis in R

The ts() function will convert a numeric vector into an R time series object. The format is ts(vector, start=, end=, frequency=) where start and end are the times of the first and last observation and frequency is the number of observations per unit time (1=annual, 4=quartly, 12=monthly, etc.).   


```{r}
seismic <- count(data, c("date", "mo"))

# set the freq parameter to 12 to indicate monthly readings
# ts() function to create a new time series
seismic_timeseries <- ts(seismic$freq, start = c(2000, 1), end = c(2008, 1), frequency = 12)   
plot(seismic_timeseries, xlab='Number of Earthquakes' ,ylab='Years', main='Earthquakes in Greece between 2000-2008')
## -------------   USE ARIMA MODEL  ---------------------
#creating ranges of possible values for the order parameters p, d, and q.
d <- 0 : 2
p <- 0 : 6
q <- 0 : 6
seismic_models <- expand.grid(d = d, p = p, q = q)
head(seismic_models, n = 4)
getTSModelAIC <- function(ts_data, p, d, q) {
                                            ts_model <- arima(ts_data, order = c(p, d, q))
                                              return(ts_model$aic)
                                              }


getTSModelAICSafe <- function(ts_data, p, d, q) {  
                                                 result = tryCatch({
                                                 getTSModelAIC(ts_data, p, d, q)
                                                  }, error = function(e) {
                                                 Inf
                                                 })
                                                 }
 
 # PICK THE BEST MODEL THAT HAS THE SMALLEST AIC 
seismic_models$aic <- mapply(function(x, y, z) 
                              getTSModelAICSafe(seismic_timeseries, x, y, z), seismic_models$p, 
                              seismic_models$d, seismic_models$q)

subset(seismic_models,aic == min(aic))
# ARIMA model for best p,d,q order model 
seismic_model <- arima(seismic_timeseries, order = c(1, 1, 1))
summary(seismic_model)
#-------------------       Prediction    ---------------------------------
plot(forecast(seismic_model, 10))
```

# Assingment

_NOTE: It's your choice to submit EITHER Lesson 02 (ARIMA models) OR Lesson 03 (Trend Analysis) for the module Time Series Analysis._   

  Answer the following questions:   
    * Can some form of Time series analysis help in your research project to forcast a prediction?
    * If it can apply Time series analysis to your research project? Does it help?   
    * If (and only if) you can't use some form of Time series analysis help in your research project then apply a form of Time series analysis to a data set you find at the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/)
