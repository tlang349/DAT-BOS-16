## What is XML?

[Extensible Markup Language (XML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. 

![XML Doc](http://54.198.163.24/YouTube/MachineLearning/IMG/XML.png) 

### XML terminology

```r
Character - An XML document is a string of characters. Almost every legal Unicode character may appear in an XML document.

* Processor and application - The processor analyzes the markup and passes structured information to an application. The specification places requirements on what an XML processor must do and not do, but the application is outside its scope. The processor (as the specification calls it) is often referred to colloquially as an XML parser.  

* Markup and content- The characters making up an XML document are divided into markup and content, which may be distinguished by the application of simple syntactic rules. Generally, strings that constitute markup either begin with the character < and end with a >, or they begin with the character & and end with a ;. Strings of characters that are not markup are content. However, in a CDATA section, the delimiters <![CDATA[ and ]]> are classified as markup, while the text between them is classified as content. In addition, whitespace before and after the outermost element is classified as markup.  

* Tag - A tag is a markup construct that begins with < and ends with >. Tags come in three flavors:
start-tag, such as <section>;
end-tag, such as </section>;
empty-element tag, such as <line-break />.  

* Element - An element is a logical document component that either begins with a start-tag and ends with a matching end-tag or consists only of an empty-element tag. The characters between the start-tag and end-tag, if any, are the element's content, and may contain markup, including other elements, which are called child elements. An example is <greeting>Hello, world!</greeting>. Another is <line-break />.  

* Attribute - An attribute is a markup construct consisting of a nameâ€“value pair that exists within a start-tag or empty-element tag. An example is <img src="bear.jpg" alt="bear" />, where the name of the attributes are "src" and "alt" and their values are "bear.jpg" and "bear" respectively. Another example is <step number="3">Connect A to B.</step>, where the name of the attribute is "number" and its value is "3". An XML attribute can only have a single value and each attribute can appear at most once on each element. In the common situation where a list of multiple values is desired, this must be done by encoding the list into a well-formed XML attribute[note 1] with some format beyond what XML defines itself. Usually this is either a comma or semi-colon delimited list or, if the individual values are known not to contain spaces,[note 2] a space-delimited list can be used. <div class="inner greeting-box">Welcome!</div>, where the attribute "class" has both the value "inner greeting-box" and also indicates the two CSS class names "inner" and "greeting-box".   

* XML declaration - XML documents may begin with an XML declaration that describes some information about themselves. An example is <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>.
```

## Additional packages needed
 
To run the code in you may need additional packages.

* If necessary install the following package(s).  

`install.packages("XML"); `  
   

```{r}
library(XML)
```


## MLB XML data

[mlb.com](mlb.com) stores statistical data from baseball games on [http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/](http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/) in an XML format.

Let's parse the master scorebord for 09/10/2016 
[http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/year_2016/month_09/day_10/master_scoreboard.xml](http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/year_2016/month_09/day_10/master_scoreboard.xml)

```{r master_scoreboard}
xml.url <- "http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/year_2016/month_09/day_10/master_scoreboard.xml"
# Use the xmlTreePares-function to parse xml file directly from the web
mlb.xml <- xmlTreeParse(xml.url)
class(mlb.xml)
xmltop = xmlRoot(mlb.xml) #gives content of root
class(xmltop) #"XMLInternalElementNode" "XMLInternalNode" "XMLAbstractNode"
print(xmltop)[1]
xmlName(xmltop) #give name of node
xmlSize(xmltop) #how many children in node
xmlName(xmltop[[1]]) #name of root's children
print(xmltop[[1]])
gameNodes <- getNodeSet(xmltop,"//game")
head(gameNodes,2)
game.id<- xmlGetAttr(xmltop[[2]], "id")
game.id
game.venue<- xmlGetAttr(xmltop[[2]], "venue")
game.venue
class(xmltop[[2]])
class(gameNodes)
gameValues <- sapply(gameNodes,xmlValue)
gameValues
```

## xmlToDataFrame() 

This function can be used to extract data from an XML document (or sub-document) that has a simple, shallow structure that does appear reasonably commonly. 

*Usage* 

```r
xmlToDataFrame(doc, colClasses = NULL, homogeneous = NA,
               collectNames = TRUE, nodes = list(),
               stringsAsFactors = default.stringsAsFactors())
```

*Arguments*

* doc	- the XML content. This can be the name of a file containing the XML, the parsed XML document. If one wants to work on a subset of nodes, specify these via the nodes parameter.

* colClasses - a list/vector giving the names of the R types for the corresponding variables and this is used to coerce the resulting column in the data frame to this type. These can be named. This is similar to the colClasses parameter for read.table. If this is given as a list, columns in the data frame corresponding to elements that are NULL are omitted from the answer. This can be slightly complex to specify if the different nodes have the "variables" in quite different order as there is not a well defined order for the variables corresponding to colClasses.

* homogeneous	- a logical value that indicates whether each of the nodes contains all of the variables (TRUE) or if there may be some nodes which have only a subset of them. The function determines this if the caller does not specify homogeneous or uses NA as the value. It is a parameter to allow the caller to specify this information and avoid these "extra" computations. If the caller knows this information it is more efficient to specify it.

* collectNames - a logical value indicating whether we compute the names by explicitly computing the union of all variable names or, if FALSE, we use the names from the node with the most children. This latter case is useful when the caller knows that the there is at least one node with all the variables.

* nodes	- a list of XML nodes which are to be processed

* stringsAsFactors - a logical value that controls whether character vectors are converted to factor objects in the resulting data frame.
