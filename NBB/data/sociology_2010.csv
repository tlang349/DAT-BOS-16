"10.2307/25677732","Invisible Girlfriend",1885171080,"This book was given to me by my best friend after finishing college. I will always treasure this thoughtful and special gift.<p>_Girlfriends_ is a collection of stories that explore and celebrate female friendship through the eyes, ears, and hearts of everyday women.  Some of the women were friends for a lifetime, others for a short time. However, all understood and/or demonstrated the meaning of &quot;true friendship.&quot; For example, the stories included everything from the thankful musings of a once-ill woman about the extraordinaty kindness of her girlfriends to a giggly account of how two eerily-simiar best friends met as assigned roomates their first day of college. (The latter tale struck very close to home in a wonderfully spooky way.)<p>While many of the stories tugged at the heartstrings, I never felt manipulated by the authors. (Note: Part of the reason why I don't like the &quot;Chicken Soup for the Soul&quot; series is that I feel that the authors are just dying to make the reader clutch for the box of tissues.)  Rather, I appreciated the &quot;real&quot; tone of the stories, as they read like good conversation shared over a nice pot of Hazlenut coffee.<p>Some readers have commented on the book's simple language and lack of depth. I don't think the goal here was to explore the psychology of friendship, rather I think it was intended to be a simple and beautiful celebration meant to be enjoyed by &quot;Girlfriends&quot; everywhere.  Enjoy!"
"10.2307/25677732","Invisible Girlfriend",1885171080,"I am a girlfriend and fortunately, God has blessed me with some fabulous girlfriends. I found a close example of each of my girlfriends in this book. This book is so clever! It's fun to give to my girlfriends and laugh over the good, bad, ugly, ridiculous and bizarre times we have had...and  these girls in the books had! It's a great book to read and to give away.  Don't miss getting this one!!"
"10.2307/25677732","Invisible Girlfriend",1885171080,"If you want to show a special girlfriend just how much you appreciate her, I suggest you purchase this book and then go through and highlight all the significant parts that describe your friendship with her. It is guaranteed to bring a tear to her eye.  It did mine."
"10.2307/25677732","Invisible Girlfriend",1885171080,"This book was given to me for my 38th b day from my best friend.  I certainly wished I had known it was out there, only so I could have bought it for her first.  It is been a great book to read, it is the kind of book that really warms your heart as you travel back in time to good memories with friends that stick with you.  It is the PERFECT gift and will be one long remembered."
"10.2307/25677732","Invisible Girlfriend",1885171080,"Our girlfriends... what would we ever do without them?  I found this book of short stories about female friendships while planning my wedding.  Although bought for me, I quickly realized this would be a wonderful way for me to express my appreciation for my bridesmaids.  At my wedding in two weeks, each will receive a copy of this book with an inscription telling why they are special to me.  Just the personal touch I was looking for!"
"10.2307/25677732","Invisible Girlfriend",1885171080,"Definitely a book that begs, &quot;buy me as a gift&quot;. And I will, my best friends birthday is today and she will receive this book when next I see her. There are quotes worthy of posting throughout. My favorite? &quot;If we can keep each other laughing, we can keep each other sane.&quot;"
"10.2307/25677732","Invisible Girlfriend",1885171080,"I was touched by each story in this book.  Some even brought tears to my eyes.  This book would be a great one to have for yourself and to give to all your friends."
"10.2307/25677732","Invisible Girlfriend",1885171080,"i found out about girlfriends:  invisible bonds, enduring ties when a good girlfriend of mine gave it to me.  i thought it really expressed how i feel about the girlfriends i have had since grade school  --  people who really know and like you for who you are, not what you have.  i have given \"Girlfriends\"  to all my close girlfriends  -- 9 of them  -- all from my years of growing up.  i think it is a way to let them know how much i value them."
"10.2307/25677732","Invisible Girlfriend",1885171080,"I was given this book and have since bought it several times over to give to several of my best girl friends. It's a great treat to give, receive and to read. Enjoyed it thoroughly."
"10.2307/25677732","Invisible Girlfriend",1885171080,"My best friend gave me this book for my birthday, and I had already bought it to give to her for her birthday.  The vignettes worked into the text are wonderful.  This is a great celebration of intimate friendship between  women.  I would highly reccommend it!"
"10.2307/25677732","Invisible Girlfriend",1885171080,"Although, at first, I was attracted by the title of the book, it was a great disappointment. I had to wade through 200 pages of collected short stories. There was no indepth analysis of why women's relationships with each other differ from those between men. The whole book read like a piece of work the two authors put together over the weekend. What a great, great disappointment."
"10.2307/20695259","Sex As Crime?",1412952980,"I took a sexual devience course in college and this was required reading. I still own the book and love it! I thought that it was very organized and written in a straight forward style- no holds barred. Not for the weak  stomach or anyone who even kinda gets the hebbie-jebbies by, say....child  pornography. Holmes WILL describe hideous events involving all sexual  deviences. What I liked most about this book was that there wasn't a lot of  confusing deep analysis of peoples' psychosis. This is a good learning tool  for anyone interested in criminology/psychology or sexual devience."
"10.2307/20695259","Sex As Crime?",1412952980,"I examined this book for possible assignment to a Doctoral level class I teach on sex offending.  Although the authors do a remarkable job of discussing an extremely wide variety of sexual behaviors, their references are seriously out of date, as is their understanding of current societal mores, and they present questionable statements as fact without any supporting evidence.		An example of the first problem - outdated references - can be found in their chapter on rape, where of 77 sources cited, only 20 are from 2000 or newer, and several of those are simply statistical updates.  Similar patterns can be found in their chapters on pornography (2 of 41), pedophilia (13 of 62), and treatment of sex offenders (5 of 29).		An example of the second - outdated understanding of current attitudes toward sexual behaviors - can be found in their section on homosexuality, in which they state that \"society in the aggregate still views the gay lifestyle as a sexual aberration,\" citing as a reference a 1991 version of their own book.  Since numerous polls show that a majority of Americans now approve of same-sex marriage, their statement is clearly outdated, at best.		Their presentation of unsupported opinions as fact shows in their statement that [although] \"There is no known reason for someone to be homosexual...homosexuality will continue to be a sexual practice that will attract a large number of people,\" with no citations of any scientific research regarding the possible causes or underpinnings of homosexuality.  They also provide - with no references or explanation - a table of \"Types of Homosexuals,\" listing the Secret Homosexual, Blatant Homosexual, Adjusted Homosexual, Institutional Homosexual, Homosexual Prostitute, and Homosexual Pedophile.		It may be worth noting that one vignette, \"Teacher's sex with student taped, say police,\" was taken from the web site for World Net Daily.  Recent articles and commentary on the WND website include \"Hope and Change 2011: Now Homo and Change,\" \"Infamous Perverts Now Obama's 'Pioneers'\" (about the Stonewall riots of 1969 that helped kick off the gay liberation movement), and \"Support Uganda's Revised 'Anti-Gay' Bill\" (now that it's dropped the provision of the death penalty in favor of life in prison).  Although the vignette is just an account of an arrest, the fact that the authors would use World Net Daily as a source at all, rather than going back to the original article about the arrest in the New Orleans Times-Picayune newspaper, makes one wonder what other biased sources may have informed the authors' views of \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" sexuality.		I can't imagine ever assigning this book to my graduate or undergraduate students.  If you have to read it, do so with an awareness of its serious flaws."
"10.2307/20695259","Sex As Crime?",1412952980,"Although this book is informative thus far (only into Chapter 2), it is riddled with so many grammatical errors one would think they hired a child for an editor.  I have never seen a published work so tarnished with errors.  I find myself editing it in my head so as to understand the writers at times.  Too bad I don't have a choice in the reading since it is the required text for my class."
"10.2307/20695259","Sex As Crime?",1412952980,"This book is being used to supplement college courses, but it should not be.  I cannot get past the obvious bias in certain sections.  Also, the book is lacking proper citations, often rendering sections unreliable.  Out of the only 10 or so citations in the first chapter, 5 cited the authors previous books (not even the raw research).  This book may be appropriate for nonacademics wishing to read an entertaining nonfiction work.  Students and academics should skip it."
"10.2307/20695259","Sex As Crime?",1412952980,"Great compilation of information, there is some bias noted, but the main complaint is this was required for a college course that took off points for grammar, misspelled words and the like yet this book has hundreds of them. I am not an English major but even just using Word it caught so many mistakes, let alone the ones that were patently obvious. I would love to re-edit this book for this Author. --Still shaking my head over this one--"
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","I only wish I had found this book 15 years ago, since I believe it would have made a profound difference in many life choices and actions and I have made through-out the years. The perspective I've gained is immense, and I think back on my life, I understand how much I contributed to many negative situations and how simple it would have been to change or stop the downward negative spiral. In addition, it provides concrete information on how to 'stop the dance', even if your part is only a small fraction of the problem. The author recommends you read this book several times, so many of our behaviors are so ingrained that I believe this is really a good idea. I have told my family and friends (many of who do not enjoy reading): \" If you only read one self-help book - This is the one to read!\" Overall, it will make you more aware of when you are entering and/or maintaining a negative situation, so it offers insight on how to handle all sorts of relationships from family to friends and acquaintances or co-workers."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","Dr. Lerner provides incredible insight into how to listen to anger, address the real issues behind anger, how to identify interpersonal patterns (dances), and how to make courageous changes in those patterns when needed.  I spent many hours contemplating the ideas introduced in this book, and feel that I have a clearer sense of myself as a result.  I have seen tangible effects in my life.  Highly recommended."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This audio book was a great source of information, not only for helping me figure out my past anger issues, but how to deal with future issues.  The examples in the book were real life and I could place myself in those situations.  I have listened to it more than once, and I still keeping finding ways to avoid anger and work on the real issues with my kids, parents, co-workers and spouse.  Again, a must for everyone...it may sound strange,but would make a great wedding present!"
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This book had a significant impact on who I am today: a more self confident person who understands that the only person truly in control of my life is: ME!<p>I love the examples of how to handle conflict situations, as for those of us who grew up without a good example, knowing that we don't deal with situations appropriately is not so helpful if we don't get clues on how to improve.<p>A friend recommended the book and I have given it to friends since. Read this book if you are not afraid of change, as change is required. Change to be a happier person.<p>I have read a lot of psychology books, this one is right to the point and spoke my language. It gave me hope and the tools to make my life better."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","I had initially suggested this book to my wife thinking that it was only for women.  While she worked on finishing another book, I decided I'd preview this one.  I ended up reading it and found it to be an amazingly helpful book, even for men.  Although it is written generally to women, any man can read this book and understand the take-home message that it delivers.  It helped me understand how my passivity is linked to suppressed anger and helped me understand how to address that.  Awesome book!!"
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","this book really explained the dance that everyone does in relationships..thought it was interesting to learn that what people complain about in relationships is really what they don't want changed and if it were changed they might try to get it to change back...appreciated this author's approach..highly recommend"
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","I read this book along with the Dance of Intimacy. I obtained guidance and resolution. Its been about 5 years since I read this book and to this day I owe many thanks to Harriet Lerner.I was able to understand and let go. Further more, improve my child's childhood.	Today I feel empowered and complete by knowing why I feel the way I do and how to accept, change what I can, and move on. I recommend this book to women of all ages but especially 23-30."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","Anger is a powerful force in relationships and this is a very useful guide to help navigate these treacherous waters. Filled with practical advice, the book helps you key into specific issues that can interfere with our desire to have harmonious and healthy relationships. If you are struggling with conflict, arguing, and other couple dynamics that can be stressful I highly recommend Sharon Rivkin's book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0762754583\">Breaking the Argument Cycle: How to Stop Fighting Without Therapy</a>. Rivkin provides proven and insightful tools that get right to the heart of what creates the argument cycle and shows us clearly in her three step process how to break the cycle once and for all. Every couple should read this book and understand these dynamics before the going gets rough!"
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","ONe of the best books on anger I have ever read.  It rang so many bells here, and was right on the money concerning my own experiences in dealing with people who are no longer in my life, but who caused me to be very angry at them.  This is a good manual on dealing with people who try to push all those vulnerable buutons that cause you to \"lose it.\"  I am a male reader, and I recommend it for males to read this book.  It's not just for women.  Men can benefit from reading and applying the message found in this work."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This book helped me realize things that didn't even cross my mind! I recommend this for every woman, even if you don't think you have problems in any relationships!"
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This book was excellent to read. I found that it has assisted me in my relationships and helped me find my true self along with reducing my anger. I would recommend this book to anyone who has anger inside of them, feels depressed or want to make their relationships better with people."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","I am a newlywed(2 years) whose honeymoon ended after the honeymoon. My husband and I fought constantly and I had a ton of pent up anger. I would never have read this book if my therapist hadn't recommened it. Thank God  for him! I used what I learned in the book to help me learn where my anger  was comming from and to help me control my anger. We now have a wonderful  relationship and we're back in the honeymoon stage!"
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","My therapist recommended this book and it has helped me immensely.  As someone who was reluctant to engage in therapy or read self-help books, I was very surprised by what Harriet Lerner's book had to offer.  Lerner explains that relationships are often stuck in patterns or &quot;dances&quot; and that these patterns repeat themselves again and again in times of anger.  Lerner shows you how you can recognize and change your own patterns.  Such changes lead to a greater understanding of self and healthier relationships.  This book can really help you to see things in a new light."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","Wow, I can't believe what an eye-opener this was, and I've recommended it to maybe 20 friends. Dance of Anger provides a clear explanation of many of the situations in which women find themselves feeling angry and not quite knowing why or how or who or most of all, what to do about it. Bottom line is, it is only by changing yourself within a relationship that you can hope to motivate (or just make it possible for) others to change and grow. Women are conditioned to stifle their anger or deny it, and this only leads to reactions in other areas that compound the situation. &quot;Anger deserves recognition.&quot;	It's definitely not a quick fix, but it just may lead to long term solutions for the things that mightily bug us in our daily relationships with spouses, parents, children, co-workers, bosses, etc., etc., etc.	Read it and give another copy to a friend - or enemy!"
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","The negative reviews I read about on this book, all expressed comments that it did not define the particular type anger that they were experiencing.  However, when my husband and I were going to marriage  consuling, my therapist recommended this book to me and it described the  situation that I was in with my husband, in that he was &quot;using&quot;  me to express HIS anger, and HIS emotions, so he could continue to appear  cool and in control.  If you are having this type problem with your  relationship, this book will help you a lot.  I highly recommend it."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","Dance of anger is a real eye opener. It points out many of the distructive loops that we are unawarely caught in, and also gives some of the tools for communicating out of them. I found it both helpful and reassuring, and I'm ready to learn more. Thank you for a wonderful book."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","Women's anger is treated very differently in society than men's anger.  We're told to suppress it, reject it, cry it out,  stifle it, or use it creatively, but we are not ever to directly express our anger.  As a result, most women don't know how to recognize their own anger for what it is, or to look for the source of their anger.  Reading this book takes time, as it helps a woman to face her anger, and grow through it.  I &quot;lose&quot; at least two copies to friends each year, who read the book, and have to write their thoughts and feelings in the margins.	Karen Holmberg-Smit"
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","My therapist recommended this book to me and I found that the writer has great insight into the cycles that we create in our lives. She gives examples of the best ways to go about breaking those cycles, thus improving life in general for you and those close to you.		If you find yourself angry and frustrated a lot, read this book because just seeing examples of how other women have gone through similar situations provides a certain piece of mind."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","I had already read &quot;The Anger Habit,&quot; and I thought that book changed my life completely. I might have stopped there, having learned so much and been so much more at peace. I'm glad I didn't. &quot;The Dance of Anger&quot; is along completely different lines, but it still has taught me invaluable lessons. Mostly, I am learning what is my responsibility and what is not. I think I had things completely backward, as so many of us do. My whole attitude and perspective have changed. My husband is impressed with the changes in me and says he will read this book after he finishes &quot;The Anger Habit.&quot; I consider this book a gift in my life, and I highly recommend it to anyone."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","A classic that everyone should have. This is a wonderful book. A different approach to working with codependent behaviors - not written using the language of the recovery movement. Wise and useful. Not simply theoretical.  Answers questions like: what do I do now?"
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This is a book that was recommended to me by my sister and I'm so glad I bought it!  I would recommend \"The Dance of Anger\" to any person who has the desire to gain insight into his/her anger and have more effective communication relationships. Thanks again!"
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This book has a totally different approach to anger compared to other Self-Help books. It has examples which look at intimate relationships which affect every woman's life- with spouse, parents and in-laws. It looks at the bigger picture like needing independence from parents, like drawing boundaries with in-laws, like forming triangles within families, and many other issues which every woman deals with. The author even recognizes the fact that a woman who looks subservient on the surface may actually be assertive. I need to read it again in order to be able to apply to my life. It was a very interesting book, very different from anything I have ever read.  So I have ordered all her other books. However I would like to stress a cautionary note. It doesn't help you with the details of communication."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","Dr. Lerner shows how to work through anger instead of acting out or reacting to it.  Very helpful for resolving inner conflict and finding the source of anger.  The insights are enlightening."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","Very insightful.  If you can't figure out why you're not getting along with family check this out."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","What an eye opener! I highly recommend it to all women. It's like seeing suddenly your blind spots - sometimes not pretty but what a relief to understand yourself better, to understand why we do what we do. I will give it to my daughter when she's adolescent. And to all young women in my family. Thank your for writing it, Mrs. Lerner!"
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","My counselor recommended this book to me when I was going through a separation and divorce.  I recently bought this book as a gift for a friend who is going through a difficult time.  Lerner's experience and insights are very helpful.  The concepts presented are provocative in that it will make the reader think about how their family of origin's relationship dynamic can often be seen reflected in the present.  A must read for anyone wondering why they keep making the same choices in partners and how to break the cycle."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","Dr. Lerner provides some excellent information on how anger influences our lives on a daily basis, particularly in interpersonal relationships. Her examples and explanations are clear and concise and as a former therapist I would heartily recommend this book as a resource for use in a therapeutic situation and for anyone seeing knowledge on the affect of anger on our lives."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This really has helped me identify why I am mad and also to stop repeating the same patterns over and over again."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This book has changed my life and the way I now see all of my relationships. The first chapter however is a little bit of history and to me seemed a little \"pro-women\". Once you get through that chapter the rest of the book is wonderful. Easy example and serious is explained and can be interpreted into your own life. It really opened my eyes in a lot of areas of my life. It actually showed me that what I thought was other emotions was actually anger and that the patterns I was in were causing it. I have re-read the entire book (minus the first chapter) twice now, and highlighted important thoughts, example for a refresher when needed! I would recommend this book and have actually bought a few friends there own copies to help them! If you haven't read it, I would say start reading now! I know the first time I read it I couldn't put it down! Life changing read!!!!"
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This one of the best.  It gives concrete examples of relationship problem.  It also gives concrete, doable suggestion on how to improve troubled relationships."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","I have immersed myself in the last year in every form of self-improvement and introspection possible.  This book and Mindfulness in Plain English are two of the best books I have read.  In some ways it reminded me of Play Like a Man, Win Like a Woman inasmuch as she was able to so beautifully articulate the female \"methodology.\"  For any woman who wants to feel like she's not the only one who feels or behaves the way she does and for a fantastic springboard to self-examination, I highly recommend this book."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","Reading this book and an applying its tools and principles changed the direction of my life almost immediately.  It's an easy read - about an uneasy topic that affects everyone.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","Harriet Lerner's books are one of the best, easy to read and understand help books that I have read to take a new look at one's most intimate relationships. I ordered one for each of my grown children and for my sister, so as to allow their relationships to develop in a balanced direction."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","Very happy with this book. It has been a great help in my journey to understand not only my own anger but others in my family and some of the issues we have been dealing with. If you are looking for something to help you understand your anger and relationships this is a GREAT book."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","I feel this is a good book for any woman dealing with anger in a variety of different relationship patterns. It helps to put a name to your emotions and your reaction to them, break free of repetitive destructive cycles, and release harbored animosity and pain."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","We can all use a little help recognizing, accepting, and managing our anger in healthy ways. This book helps you do that. 4 stras because it was more a read for knowledge than a book I couldn't put down or couldn't wait to share."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","I love this book. I learned so much about myself and my interpersonal relationships by reading it. It is really great to know that other people can really relate to your thoughts and feelings and that we all have the power to change them!"
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This book explained the interactions of people in such amazing accuracy.  It included great examples of different relationships and how anger was expressed in each... and how to make the changes in myself to get what I want and need out of my life and relationships... at home, at work, with kids, etc..  Amazingly written and a wonderful help. I highly recommend this book."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","A very useful guide to dealing with suppressed and hidden anger.  The author shows how anger awareness is an important pschological tool.		Although written from a woman's perspective, it is very helpful for anyone dealing with these issues.  It also has many helpful examples of how couples can improve the way they communicate."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","Think that you don't have an anger problem because you usually keep your temper bottled and just stew and feel resentful?  Think again!  Feel frustrated and angry at the people around you who, no matter how much you plead, won't change and start behaving the way you want?  Here's a solution.  <p>Dr. Harriet Lerner's &quot;The Dance of Anger&quot; provides a whole new approach for women who feel stuck and powerless.  Using case studies, Lerner demonstrates ways that women can change their reactions when other people's behavior and expectations upsets them.  Her basic premise:  You can't change how others treat you--you can only change how you respond.  Throughout the book, Lerner provides examples of how women can set boundaries with friends, family members and others so that they can break out of unsatisfying relationship patterns.<p>The &quot;Thinking in Threes&quot; chapter addresses ways that third parties get pulled into conflicts, and how to better handle these situations by focusing on the source of the conflict.<p>Lerner's book is an excellent source for learning a &quot;new dance&quot;--a new way of approaching life.  One caveat:  I question whether this approach would be safe or appropriate for someone dealing with domestic violence or an emotionally abusive relationship.  While several experts in that area have said that the reason people abuse is because it works, making the abuse no longer work by using Lerner's approach of changing one's reaction to that behavior could make the abuse escalate.  From the training I've received in domestic violence (I'm not a therapist but I do have some professional training in this area), I believe that the most dangerous time for someone in an abusive relationship occurs when she tries to get out of that relationship.  Changing one's response to abusive behavior under Lerner's recommendations might make the situation more dangerous."

It explains the dynamics of everyday life....  Whether with a spouse, family member or someone at work... We all get angry over things and handle it differently...  This book helps explain those feelings and gives great tips on how to heal yourself and deal with the issues."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This book contains many things that are true and useful. To me, the failing was in preaching that you can change yourself, but not another person. But almost all the examples show that if you change, the other person also changes, and life become harmonious. There is almost nothing about how to cope when you make changes, but the other person does not."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","I was going to a counselor trying to wade through the emotions that were crippling me. How can such strong emotions create such paralysis? I found myself writing down almost every word she said. Where did she get such fresh truth that I needed? I asked her, \"Can you recommend a book that will help me? For instance (pointing to the notes I was scribbling as she spoke)  where did you get this information?\"  The Dance of Anger, by Harriet Lerner was her response. I left the session, went to the bookstore and found it! $10 at the time--a paperback dynamo full of challenges to change the Dance! Warning: it's true. You change the dance and you're in for a fight--but that fight might save your life."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","Few self-help books stick around this long.  This one has for good reason.  I consider myself to be a pretty psychologically minded person.  My husband and I spend long hours trying to understand ourselves and others.  This book helped me to understand many of the issues I was dealing with with my parents.  It discusses the flip side of depression--anger.  This was an important topic for me to understand better and the author explains it well.  I often recommend this book to my friends."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","Harriet Lerner is highly educated; a renowned psychologist and a prolific writer. My formal education ended at the age of thirteen. However, since Lerner is using case histories to support her ideas, I am taking the liberty to comment on one case.		Lerner interprets the constant fighting between Maggie and her mother to: \"Maggie was trying to change her mother rather than clearly state her own beliefs and convictions and stand behind them.\"I was born 85 years ago in a small town in Poland. It would have been inconceivable, then, for a child at any age, to criticize, preach, instruct, blame, or fight a mother, as Maggie did. No child would dare to talk back to a parent. A child was expected to obey a parent. (Hebrew term for discipline is mishmat meaning to listen). Most parents love their children and obviously wish to see them happy as kids and eventually as adults. Loving your child should be unconditional, but the child should be obedient. Parents' life experience had taught them, at a high cost, how to avoid pitfalls. The old saying: \"We teach what we most need to learn\" is seldom applicable to parents; they have already learned by their life experience.		My father adhered religiously to the fifth commandment of the Bible, \"Honor your father and mother so that you may live longer.\" Every day, before leaving for his business, my father made it his business to take care of his aging mother's needs.  My father told me once: \"Your grandmother is now as a little child is; she depends on me as you are. I would never neglect her just as I would never neglect you. It is my duty to take care of both of you with the same devotion.\" It is written that it is a divine mandate for us to show thoughtfulness, dignity and compassion to those who brought us into the world. That concept doesn't reverberate in Lerner's evaluations.		Nowadays, we are able to produce computers or travel to the moon. However, our technological sophistication cannot ignore the wisdom of sages who lived thousands of years ago. Our sages said: \"Who is a wise person? A wise person is the one that learns from his experience, but the wisest person is the one that learns from somebody else's experience. I have learned that parents and family elders are an anchor to lean on; a fountain of wisdom and heritage to drink from. Unrequited devotion from children for parents is very painful.		THE DANCE of ANGER is well-written and informative. The author's bottom line is that anger will lead you nowhere. I wholeheartedly agree. After the liberation from concentration camps I realized that 123 members of my extended family were murdered by the Nazis. I had many obvious reasons to be angry and bitter, but I realized, after a while, that anger will not mitigate my tragic past and present situation. I determined not to be bitter but better (From a Name to a Number p. 229)"
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","Wow! When I bought this book I thought it was going to target a hot temper or a nice lady who suddenly blows from holding it in. It's soo much more. It is a must read for so many women. I would do so much for  people & then get aggrivated when I'd ask them to do something for me & they wouldn't. I'd get so hurt. It was so unfair, I do so much for you... This book really opened my eyes to why am I doing things for others & not expecting anything in return but then would get upset when I would ask a favor every once in a while and it wasn't granted. Nobody told me to be overfunctioning. I just wanted to be nice. The end result was I was putting me last then get upset when others that I put before me put me last. It's so much easier and more peace of mind to put me first. I can't believe how clear this book made me see that and changed my everyday life."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","I read this book in 1990 and remember it being helpful and clearly written. There are not many books that stick in my mind after ten years!

As soon  as she asked for advice, this title came to mind."

I still follow Ms. Lerner's advice in my dealings with my family and others.

I recommend this book for anyone that is pursuing personal understanding or for understanding of people in general.		You are given tools to use to break out of old habits with communication.  I have actually tried some when I found my self in a reoccurring emotional situations and it worked!		It is a good read.  It is not just for women.

"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","I've had this book on my shelf for several years and just now got around to finishing it.  The wisdom and truth contained in this book is timeless.  As true today as it was 15 years ago for it speaks of the human condition and the complexity of communication sytles in relationships.<p>Lerner's book addresses the social issues that impact communication styles. It also outlines how we create stuck patterns in our relationships by refusing to speak the truth and be direct.  She outlines the concepts of overfunctioning or underfuntioning. And the importance of being honest and &quot;human&quot; if we want to achieve balance in our relationships.<p>I've been reading Lerner's book off and on for about a year.  Somewhere in the middle of the book I realized how I was stuck in an ineffective pattern with my husband.  Her book gave me insight into an appropriate, loving way to handle it.  I took what I learned, applied it and saw results.  But not instantly.<p>Lerner warns the reader not to expect instant results.  Communication styles and relationship patterns are often deeply entrenched and automatic.  It takes conscious and continuous commitment to reap the rewards of new communication styles.  However, if you're tired of feeling misunderstood, mistreated or marginalized, you'll find the effort well worth it.<p>I found this book uplifting yet realistic.  It outlines a healthy, empowering way to communicate with your loved ones without getting into the blame game or feeling like a victim.  I recommend it to anyone with a pattern of anger or conflict in relationships."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This book was recommended to me by a friend during a tough time in my relationship.  I would not have chosen it for myself as until I read it, I didn't really perceive that anger was a big problem for me.  Now I realise that I was quite unaware of the many different responses and methods of expression of anger we have as women. Furthermore, this book reveals how deeply damaging and destructive suppressed anger can be.  Harriet Lerner uses case histories to simply and effectively communicate her ideas in an easily understandable way.  The fundamental gift of this book for me, is that it is an aid to a very important realisation which fosters our empowerment and liberation:  When we see that we follow patterns of behaviour and can start to identify or simply notice them,  this realisation  gives us a sense of objectivity about our feelings.  This is the key to setting ourselves free to love and live as we choose."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","And I don't say that lightly. I originally bought Harriet Lerner's Dance of Anger b/c I couldn't seem to stop myself from crying during petty disagreements with the people close to me.  &quot;I just don't like conflict,&quot; I explained dismissively, &quot;I'm a Cancer.&quot;  But in reality, it made me feel weak, powerless and out of control, and I wanted to change it.<p>Turns out I was just so afraid of being mad that it was coming out as tears!<p>Probably the most valuable lesson in Harriet Lerner's Dance of Anger is that you only change yourself - not other people.  Sounds simple, but by using case studies involving women and their partners, children, siblings, parents, and co-workers, Lerner offers specific examples of the ways we contribute to the behavior cycles (or &quot;dances&quot;) in all of our relationships - and offers specific suggestions for how to change those cycles.<p>The weekend after I finished the book, I immediately began to change MY BEHAVIOR in the most important relationship in my life - and everything Lerner detailed would probably happen, has.  It's eerie to be so textbook, but I feel centered, self-aware and powerful for the first time in a long time - and it's not at anyone else's expense."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","If you've been in a relationship where you have felt angry deep inside, and have tried many ways to express it only to find yourself getting nowhere, this is a great book to help you to learn how to recognize and express anger. Harriet Lerner brings awareness to anger in the categories she calls \"silent submission\" \"ineffective fighting and blaming\" and \"emotional distancing.\"		She shows the many ways that you can learn how to view different situations in a relationship, where you are more aware and not caught in the trap of the above patterns. This book brought me a great deal of understanding about anger. I wholeheartedly recommend it, and have found this book to be one of the best on this subject. I also have to recommend another book that was a life saving grace to me by Barbara Rose called \"Stop Being the String Along\" it saved my sanity. If you're in a romantic relationship with someone where you are feeling anger and frustration I strongly suggest getting both books, they can very well save your sanity too."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","I've bought this book so many times for my friends.  It's the first book I've read that actually gives simple techniques for changing complicated behavior.  And it addresses those that say they are okay with everything but don't realize how it builds inside.  It also addresses those of us who let everyone have it, but never resolve anything -- now maybe people will really listen.  Whether you're angry or not and whether you're male or female -- this book has techniques that anyone can put to use."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This book is the greatest self help book I have ever read.  And I've read plenty!  In clear, easy to understand real life examples, Harriet Lerner succinctly explains the bugaboo of all relationships---over functioning and  underfunctioning.  From her book I truly learned how nagging and pitching a  fit keeps me and my loved ones in non proactive relationships. Lerner  explains so clearly something that I secretly felt but couldn't put my  finger on---  when I get worked up and emotional about something my  husband, friends, family members don't have to get emotional. Because I'm  doing all the emoting or as Lerner says, overfunctioning. Once I read this  book I quickly got off the lamest teeter totter ever created and started  getting real results in my life.  Every woman should read this book."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This book is fantastic.  It's full of great insights and has really begun to help me deal with my relationship patterns - especially the most difficult one in my life - my relationship with my mother.  I have  recommended this book to all of my friends.  The methods Harriet Lerner  uses are practical and easy to apply in everyday situations.  I have  learned to &quot;break patterns&quot; and am learning to de-victimize  myself.  The insights are so simple and easy to remember, you can apply  them quickly in whatever situation you find yourself.  READ THIS BOOK!  You'll thank yourself."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This is an excellent book whether you have anger issues or not. This book can truly help you with all of your relationships if you let it. This book was highly recommended by my therapist.		It helps you identify feelings and helps you figure out what makes you feel that way. Most importantly, it explains how to deal with those feelings and talk about those feelings. It teaches you \"fair fighting\" and how to effectively talk things out. This book doesn't point fingers and say there is \"something wrong\" with you. It is written in \"we, us\" form - letting you know that there are so many people out there who haven't figured out how to identify our feelings and in turn get angry or bottle anger.		Of course everyone gets defensive and says \"I'm not an angry person\", but that's the thing about this book; you don't have to be an angry person to benefit from what it has to say. For instance, my sister, who is just as sweet as sugar was very reluctant to read this book. She finally did and used all of it's bits of advice to improve communication in her marriage. This book talks about dealing with your spouse or significant other, your parents and siblings, in laws, even your children.		I very highly recommend this book to all women."

This one deals with all different types of relationships, and gives specific advice about breaking out of cyclical patterns of behavior, while the other book deals with the relationship between you and your mate.<p>I gave this book to my daughter, since we've been battling since she was born.

"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","I think we all dismiss reviews that do nothing but gush and write word after glowing word about a book that we feel has changed our lives.  And it's easy to dismiss those reviews until you come across that one book that makes you feel the same way.  For me, it was &#34;The Dance of Anger&#34; by Harriet Lerner.		This book was a person choice to read after finding myself often feeling frustrated and irate about things that shouldn't make me feel that way. Sometimes we can write it off as a bad day, PMS, bad night's sleep, lack of coffee, or running into grumpy people all day.  Whatever the cause, it was tiresome feeling cranky. I've read other books on anger, even done workbooks, but nothing really affected me the way this book did. I can say that she laid it all out in simple terms, but she didn't. Ms. Lerner didn't take the &#34;dumb it down&#34; route that some authors do because they feel the readers won't understand all the psychological mumbo-jumbo.		From the first page of this book to the last, I had so many &#34;ah-ha&#34; and &#34;oh my Lord&#34; and &#34;that's me!&#34; moments that with the highlighting and post-it flags the book now resembles a neon pinata. This book has a permanent spot on my headboard for whenever I find myself having a bad day, which I have to admit is now a rare occurrence. For the first time, after reading so many other books on anger, I finally truly understand the dance, the circle dance that we do to perpetuate the circular dance of anger.  And it comes down to having the courage to step up within yourself and be the one to walk away from the dance.  It's the hardest yet easiest thing I have ever done. It's been several weeks since I finish this book for the first time, and the change in my behavior is noticeable to everyone I know. And my behavior helps influence their behavior, which helps them step away from the dance of anger. Several friends and family members have purchased and read this book, and we all agree that it's a must read.		By reading this book, or even taking the step to buy it, it doesn't mean that you have anger issues. Every one of us is entitled to feel grumpy and cranky and irate just as we are entitled to feel happy and less stressed and calm. Ms.Learner explains how life's little annoyances can creep into our lives and add to whatever stress we already have. Her goal is to help keep those little annoyances and stressors out of our lives, to stop the stupid arguments over who forgot to pick up the mail.		If you have ever wanted to stop letting the small matters snowball into big problems, please read this book. It really will make a difference."

"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This book is wonderful.  It would be helpful to anyone - men and women alike when have just about any type of relationship problem.  She is great about explaining that our relationships - when they are not at an optimal level get stuck in a pattern.  Like an overfunctioning parent results in an underfunctioning child...hit home on that one.  It isn't an anger management book, really - more that when you feel some anxiety in a relationship - it can be due to anger but more importantly a bad pattern of behavior.  Even better, she gives examples of how to begin to &quot;break&quot; the pattern - or how she says &quot;Dance&quot; - you move differently and the dance changes!  Great book - helpful for work issues, marital issues, and child rearing.  Notes that unresolved issues with first family replay themselves in the family we make for ourself.  You will not regret reading this book - written in such a way that is easy to read."

This book helped me figure out when people in my life where using their anger to manipulate me.  It helped me figure out why I was mad and how to figure out what to do with it.		The best part was learning about triangles and how to remove myself from them.		All my relationships have improved immensely.		I've since bought Harriet Lerner's other books and they are just as excellent."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This book was recommended to me by my therapist, who claimed it was an excellent book for helping women learn to deal with some of life's difficult situations.  And it delivers!  Learning the &quot;dance&quot; steps was so enlightening.  Dr. Lerner helps the reader to understand complex interpersonal behaviors using language we can all relate to.  Her section near the end of the book on &quot;triangles&quot; (an example is when your mother complains to you about your brother/sister, rather than talking to him/her directly) was equally helpful to me.  I knew what the problem was in my family, but now I have an understanding of the underlying issues as well as how to avoid this very upsetting trap that some of us find ourselves caught in.  This was my first Harriet Lerner book, and it's underlined throughout.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is serious about wanting to improve her relationships.  If you are not serious, however, if you only want some handholding, you may as well call a sympathetic friend instead.  This book will greatly help those who are ready to work at their relationships, but the fainthearted will probably not benefit much from all it has to offer."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","_The Dance of Anger_ is a book that I periodically re-read and more frequently recommend. Lerner addresses many different varieties of anger in aid of helping the reader to constructively place and channel the anger in their lives. It is smart, but clear, with interesting examples that keep the reader turning the pages-- even when the case studies discussed don't apply to them."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","The Dance of Anger has been the most helpful book I have ever read on the subject.

"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This book has literally changed my life for the better.  My husband and I have been having difficulties for the past four years and I had been trying everything I was able to think of to change the relationship for the better while he has made clear that he is not willing to change.  The Dance of Anger explained how we got stuck and so polarized and for the first time I was able to see how I had been contributing to our difficulties while trying to protect him from his anxieties.  I have listened to the audio version several times now, which reinforced my new behavior; it has broken the old dance.  I feel much better about myself now and have noticed that my husband has become less tense and reactive as well.  I highly recommend this book as well as The Dance of Connection."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","I found some useful insight into anger, along with some helpful and unhelpful ways to deal with it.  However, I found it very frustrating to read all of the links between anger patterns and gender. While I believe there is probably some correlation between gender and anger (i.e. women are often taught to de-self in order to go along with others and prevent conflict, men might be more likely to be taught to distance from feelings), I think it is a loose correlation (I know many logical and calm females and many feeling sensitive males, and vice versa, and everything in between).  I don't see how labeling some anger patterns as typically male or female is supposed to help clarify anger patterns in oneself.  In fact, I find it counterproductive and distracting from the real matter.  Isn't the point to find out what anger patterns you might be exhibiting in your own life and create positive ones?  Why not leave the gender stuff out of it and discuss different healthy and unhealthy anger patterns for people to identify with or not?  Why sidetrack and convolute the issue by saying females will typically act this way, and males will typically act this way, when the author even says this isn't always true? Unless you believe your gender directly causes your anger pattern 100% of the time, I just don't see the point."

"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","When I read a book that inspires me, I mark the pages that I want to go back and study again.  Of the 232 pages in 'The Dance of Anger', I turned down over 50 corners.	 My first reading was in 1989, and I still go back and find reasons why this book made such an impact on my life.  The biggest lesson was to put more 'I' in my life.  Then, to remember, that I have a right to my thoughts and feelings;  that no one else will take responsibility for me;  that I cannot change other people;  and, that the only person I have power over is myself.	 The 'Dance' has to do with becoming your own person without losing others.  'Anger' is a tool for managing our relationships and helping us become our best.	 I have recommended this book to many friends who are angry - at themselves, at their partners, at their families, at their employers - and, who have expressed a desire to improve their lives.	 The book offers many excellent suggestions such as 'The Plan for Reshaping':  think about your problem;  seek temporary distance from it;  don't place blame, be vague, or tell others how to feel;  appreciate everyone's differences;  speak up for yourself;  and, use 'I'.	 Take the challenge.  Read the book.  Become your own person.		This review is also posted on the Story Circle Book Review Website at www.storycirclebookreviews.org"

"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","As Lerner says, anger is an emotion which is always deserving of our attention and respect.  However, the expression of anger can do as much to perpetuate an unhappy situation as to change it.  Drawing on the theories of Murray Bowen, Lerner offers examples of how some familiar patterns are maintained and how they might be changed. Unlike many authors of self-help books, Lerner also brings a political awareness to the 'problem' of anger. Also very readable is Deborah Luepnitz, The Family Interpreted: Feminist Theory in Clinical Practice."

She also states in the book that in every situation you might not be as calm as you'd like but understands it takes practice and we're all just human.  I recommend this book for ALL women even you don't think you're angry- its very helpful for various situations including marriage/partners, families, work, etc"
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","Harriet Lerner's THE DANCE OF ANGER has been around for a number of years and it is still a classic and quite useful for anyone who wants to understand how anger works and doesn't work for them.  It is most clearly aimed at women but men can also benefit from what this very wise therapist has to say.  It's a book I continue to come back to and I recommend it to many of my psychotherapy patients."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","Well, I am not quite finished yet, but I have already determined that this book is amazing.		I am one who has dealt with anger issues since I can remember.  I have been both the \"psychotic bitch\" as the book describes as well as the \"nice lady\" as is also described.  Neither are good positions, but this book teaches the reader to understand why she is behaving as she does, and some strategies to use the anger to seek the real reason for her emotional responses, whether they be outbursts, or exercises in suppressing true frustration.		I have had so many \"aha\" moments from reading this book.  Like a lightbulb went on.		Strategies for taking charge and resolving the issues are also shared.  They are not necessarily easy, but they show that with determination, and commitment to one's self, we can improve, and lessen the anger.		The book uses examples between various family relationships to illustrate typical patterns of behavior.  I recognized myself in many of them, and watched how certain actions resulted in various consequences.  This \"modeling\" method is easy to read and relate to.  Great book.  Worth every cent, and every moment."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","I first stumbled into this book in 1992/3. Since then, it has been one of THE books I bring me with wherever I've lived --I find that across so many contexts, cultures and situations it provides useful, practical and respectful advice and thought EVERY time. One of my favorite quotes she's said over the years --attributed to a colleague --is \"speak up speak up speak up...the only person you'll scare off, is your future ex husband\". This could refer any potential future ex-whatever (wife, colleague, friend, etc) I just ordered a new copy, because my old one is so highlighted, dog eared and faded to the point of distraction, this is how often I've used and read it. If you are looking for insight on how to productively recognize, respect and respond to your own internal signals of anger that something is not working right, get this book. One hard part is respecting the fact that once we live in a more centered and self expressive way --by expressing our core truths--others may not accept these things or may not choose to engage with what our truth is. In other words, they may leave. Its true, the letting go part is very very hard and this fear of loss has often prevented me from speaking up clearly. And this is exactly one of Dr Lerners points --that generally speaking, women are often held back through internalized socialized messages of 'dont get angry because others won't like you\" (and this is bad, of course) and adhering to these messages is a very effective way to keep things calm and 'other focused' for women. And this is not a victim based, finger pointing idea --its simply the way many societies are organized and she makes the good points that there are many many positive aspects to being very concerned about others and the benefits of compassion. The trouble is when is comes at too high a cost of our own well being, which is what generates anger. I use this book in my professional teamwork consultancies and nearly constantly in my own life relationships. A real gem, one that we can all relate to, any time, anywhere."

Instead it pushed him farther away from me and we fought more. I felt like my back was to the wall and a friend suggested this book. Great suggestion! I never knew how common my issue was let alone that a solution could be found! This book helped me see that solution and gave me hope.

She was angry. Angry that her husband had a problem. But the fact is we can't change other people or their attitudes or wants or desires.		So, we MUST TAKE CONTROL OF OUR OWN LIVES.

"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This author has the very narrow minded view that there are only two types of people in the world, those who are angry and those who are suppressing their anger.

"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This is a great book on the value of anger, and differs from many of the other anger books because it is not about impulse control. Unfortunately, all anger books - even the best ones - are inadequate.		I have read many books on the so-called \"negative\" emotions and most helpful for me were \"To Love is to be Happy With\" by Barry Kaufman, who founded the wonderful Options Institute in the U.S. and \"Nonviolent Communication: a Language of Life\" by Marshall B. Rosenberg (his Center for Nonviolent Communication trains in North America, Europe & UK, Malaysia and India and Rosenberg has a great book called \"The Surprising Purpose of Anger\").		Also, I have done a huge amount of \"work\" on myself for well over 2 decades yet all this wholehearted work did not result in much success with anger. Eventually - after more than TWO decades of wasted time and money (lots of time, lots of money), I discovered uncontrollable anger is very strongly linked to health. ALL anger-advice books overlook insufficient adrenals, yet one of the MAJOR symptoms is constant irritation. (That's why this book gets it more right than most - adrenal fatigue definitely makes you fragile as well as a lot of other things, like trouble sleeping and/or difficulty getting to sleep, overreacting/defensive, fatigue and/or jittery, lightheaded getting out of bed, and much more.)		Finally, after decades of mis-diagnoses (very common, I have learned) serious low thyroid AND low adrenal function was identified, but only because I was finally lucky enough to come across \"Stop the Thyroid Madness\" (both website and book are excellent on both thyroid and adrenal issues). I had to arrange and pay for my own lab tests (the so-called \"gold standard\" tests are wrong!) and then (because most doctors, including endos, really do not understand) find a truly knowledgeable physician through patient recommendations on the \"Stop the Thyroid Madness\" website.		After a few months of PROPER treatment my anger/irritability simply melted away! (slowly)		The more stress you have had in your lifetime, the more likely you are to have adrenal issues (I had a high-powered job for 20 years but then had to limp through the last ten years before I was able to retire by going part-time - which of course meant low quality work at much lower pay). So, here are some FREE home/self tests for identifying struggling adrenals:		TEST ONE:	Take and compare two blood pressure readings--one while lying down and one while standing. Rest for five minutes while sitting before taking the first reading. Stand up and immediately take the blood pressure again. If either blood pressure reading is lower after standing, suspect adrenal gland problems, and more specifically, an aldosterone issue-another adrenal hormone. The degree to which the blood pressure drops while standing is often proportionate to the degree of hypoadrenalism. (Normal adrenal function will raise your BP on the standing reading in order to push blood to the brain.) It can be wise to do this test both in the morning and in the evening, since you can appear normal one time, and not another. (BP monitors are available cheaply on Amazon)		TEST TWO:	Let someone shine a bright light your way. Do you find yourself very sensitive and uncomfortable with the bright light (similarly with bright summer sunshine)? That could be a sign of adrenal fatigue. And this can also be true if you have searing headaches along with the sensitivity.		TEST THREE:	This is called the Pupil test and primarily tests your levels of aldosterone, another adrenal hormone. You need to be in a darkened room with a mirror and a flashlight/ torch/ penlight. Do this later in the day as results are more reliable then. From the side (not the front), shine a bright light towards your pupils and hold it for about a minute. Carefully observe the pupil. With healthy adrenals (and specifically, healthy levels of aldosterone), your pupils will constrict, and will stay small the entire time you shine the light from the side. In adrenal fatigue, the pupil will get small, but within 30 seconds, it will soon enlarge again or obviously flutter in its attempt to stay constricted.		Why? Because adrenal insufficiency can also result in low aldosterone, which causes a lack of proper amounts of sodium and an abundance of potassium. This imbalance causes the sphincter muscles of your eye to be weak and to dilate in response to light. (Note: there are over 50 sphincters in the body and stress incontinence caused by adrenal fatigue is difficult to fix just with pelvic floor exercises.)		TEST FOUR:	Take your temp 3 times a day, starting three hours after you wake up, and every three hours after that, to equal three temps. (If you have eaten or exercised right before it's time to take your temp, wait 20 more minutes.) Then average them for that day. Do this for AT LEAST 5 days. If your averaged temp is fluctuating from day to day more than .2 to .3 (with a lean towards .2), you need adrenal support. Again, your daily average temps should lean towards the .2 when on enough cortisol for your needs.		If your temps are fluctuating but overall low, you need both adrenal and thyroid support. If your temps are fluctuating but averaging 98.6, you just need adrenal support. If it is steady but low, you need thyroid support and adrenals are likely fine.	(mercury thermometers are the most accurate but very difficult to buy nowadays, next best are liquid thermometers, then digital thermometers - which can be wrong by up to 1degreeF. Do NOT use ear thermometers.)		TEST FIVE:	This is the easiest home test for adrenal deficiency, from Wilson's excellent 2001 book (still a classic) called \"Adrenal Fatigue\": all you need for this test is a ball point pen. Drag the dull end of a pen across your abdomen for about six inches (my guess would be about 2 fingers' width above or below your belly button) but don't press overly hard or scratch the skin. If your adrenals are functioning normally or are only mildly affected, the mark will turn from white to red within about 10 seconds. If your adrenals are fatigued, however, the line will widen and stay white for about 2 minutes. This test isn't terribly accurate as it only shows up on about 40 per cent of people with low adrenal function. It generally tests positive only if the adrenal fatigue is fairly severe.		The outer cortex of our adrenal glands produces the hormones cortisol, aldosterone, testosterone, DHEA, DHEAS, androstenedione and estrogens. Dysfunctional adrenals equates first to combined highs and lows of cortisol that are not normal, then to low cortisol (and sometimes low aldosterone as well as imbalances in other hormones). The Stop the Thyroid Madness website has much free practical information on adrenal issues as well as low thyroid. If you want a lab test, to confirm any self-test results, the most useful - and most accurate - is the 24-hour saliva test which is not very expensive (don't let your doctor insist on the unreliable blood test or urine test)."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","This book is an absolute MUST HAVE. I have learned that Anger is not a bad thing or a good thing: It simply is. I love how the writer puts this issue of anger in the form of a dance, it really does make total sense and it helps you to put a practical application to something that is not tangible like Anger. I plan on reading this book again, because there is so much here that I know I'll learn something new the next time I read it."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","I bought this book on a recommendation by a psychologist I was going to for help in my marriage. After I bought it I read it so throughly that I used a yellow highlighter to mark pertinent parts that really applied to the  status quo of not only my husband, but my parents and the ways the under-functioning / over-functioning dynamics worked in various relationships.		  In fact, after having this book as a tool to apply to my life, I didn't need to see the therapist anymore- the book gave me more direction than therapy did!		  I told my fellow co-workers (mostly female) about this amazing book, and lent it to one, who then passed it on to another, and so on and so forth. When I got the book back afterwards, I was interested to find out that each one had used their own highlighter (in a different color). The book was a rainbow of colors from all the different passages that stood out as they pertained to each one.		  I always point people I know to this book. No matter that everyone has different issues, this book can help clarify those persistent problems that never seem to get resolved no matter how hard you try.		  I have read Ms. Lerner's other books, and although they are good, they don't really hit the nail on the head like this one did."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","I bought both the CD and book for this title, recommended by my counselor. The CD has been listened to on my trips to and from work, and the book has been a continuing reference. I saw/see myself in so many of the situations detailed by the author; I could have been the woman with a very similar story. As I realized that patterns had been deeply set, I knew that I had to be the one to start the changes. Was it difficult? Of couse, but I needed to stop the cycle that was destroying my relationship. It has been more than three months since I first started using this guide. With the help of a wonderful therapist, I can say that the relationship with my husband is stronger than I ever felt it would be. There is still more work to be done, and I will continue. I do not want anger to ever control me/us again."

In fact, I didn't believe that any self help book could really be helpful. Was I ever wrong. Without even realizing the lessons sunk into my semiconsciousness and over the years I found myself using Lerner's lessons more and more, sometimes without even realizing at the time from where I had obtained my new insights, courage and skills. I even got a sense of camaraderie from this book, realizing I was not alone in carving out a clearer self. I recently reread this book after a few years, and I was really gratified to see how I had improved my functioning in my relationships. I still have plenty of work left but hey, I could have been used case study in this book."

I find that you can't help but refer back to many pages, even sections, over and over again because what Ms. Lerner writes resonates so true that you feel as though she has evesdropped on your life and your patterns of behavior regarding anger.  Her counsel is not easy to persevere in but if you do, you will find yourself being more at peace with yourself."

Yes, the material is definately targeted towards women, but you can just as easily substitute  &quot;anyone who is committed to an intimate relationship&quot; for  &quot;woman&quot; in the text. As for myself, I substitute the masculine  for the feminine as needed, such as in one of my favorite  quotes:<p>&quot;...A man avoids confict by defining his own wishes and  preferences as being the same as what his partner wishes and prefers him to  be. He defines his own self as she defines him. He sacrifices his awareness  of who he is in his efforts to conform to her wants and expectations.

"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","When I read a book that inspires me, I mark the pages that I want to go back and study again. Of the 232 pages in The Dance of Anger, I turned down over 50 corners. My first reading was in 1989, and I still go back and find reasons why this book made such an impact on my life.		The biggest lesson was to put more 'I' in my life. Then, to remember that I have a right to my thoughts and feelings; that no one else will take responsibility for me; that I cannot change other people; and that the only person I have power over is myself.		The Dance of Anger has to do with becoming your own person without losing others. Anger can be a tool for managing our relationships and helping us become our best. I have recommended this book to many friends who are angry--at themselves, at their partners, at their families, at their employers--and, who have expressed a desire to improve their lives. It offers many excellent suggestions such as 'The Plan for Reshaping': think about your problem; seek temporary distance from it; don't place blame, be vague, or tell others how to feel; appreciate everyone's differences; speak up for yourself; and use the pronoun \"I\".		Take the challenge. Read the book. Become your own person.		by Doris Anne Roop-Benner	for Story Circle Book Reviews	reviewing books by, for, and about women"
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","I bought this book at the recommendation of my therapist.  Once I started reading this, I wondered, why?  Why did she recommend this?  I never thought of myself as \"angry\", however as I kept reading I realized the book is about most women I know, including myself, who constantly habor the same feelings and resentments, day after day, month after month - the dance - with no resolution in sight.  I recommend this book to anyone - man or woman - who feels stuck in a rut in a personal relationship, ANY personal relationship, with no growth or maturation in sight.  It will lead you to understand that you are only responsible for yourself and that you cannot change anyone else - whether you are concious of the fact that you are \"hoping\" for this change or not!  Loved it!"
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","A large number of books on the topic of anger have recently come into my house -- how to recognize anger, what it means, and how to &quot;control&quot; it. This is the only one of these books that I liked. All the other books on this topic seem to treat anger as a loss of control, which should be repressed. In fact, they seem to be about impulse control more than about anger. (I have nothing against people learning to control their impulses, I just don't think that it's the same topic as the topic of anger.) Luckily, I did not pay for any of these books, so I can just be glad I read this one, and forget about the others.<p>In this book, Lerner treats anger as a signal that something is going wrong. She explains that only when we address the &quot;something wrong&quot; in a useful way will the anger go away. Then she explores the &quot;dances&quot; we engage in, in our attempts to make ourselves feel better. She suggests that most of our attempts to make ourselves feel better focus on the person(s) we think made us mad, rather than on ourselves. She compassionately and wisely shows how to disengage from the anger and the counter-productive patterns, while staying connected and acting with integrity. However, she also acknowledges the effect that this sort of change can have on other people in the dance, and she provides guidance in maintaining oneself in the face of countermoves. <p>Fundamentally, this is not the kind of self-help book that provides 10 easy steps to ridding oneself of anger. Instead, it describes a different way to think about anger, and discussion of the ways in wich one can respond to anger. No easy steps, just a way of thinking, which can radically change the way one engages with the world."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","I found this book as impossible to put down as any thriller -- it was fascinating even when it didn't directly apply to me.  But most of it did.<p>All my life I have had a problem expressing anger.  It usually comes  out as tears, which does not impress anyone or improve the situation, or  else I swallow it and tell myself it's not important.  This book has helped  me to understand that when I'm angry, it means something is wrong, and I  attempt to calmly identify what that is, and take steps to make it better.  I'm not expert at this yet, but the book has given me hope that small  changes can lead to big improvement over time.<p>All in all, this is a  great book for anyone whose anger has ever made them feel ashamed or  powerless.

If you never learned good solutions for understanding and dealing with your anger, this is a book you need to read. It is filled with insight about anger. It also offers constructive solutions for getting rid of anger, and improving relationships with people who make us angry. It deals with generational patterns of anger! This book is not just for women. Men, too, could learn a lot from reading this book and putting it's suggestions into practice. Very highly recommended."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","I was truly able to relate to the family situations and common anger responses discussed in this book. I soon came to realize how I have been mishandling my anger for most, if not all, of my adult life. The author discusses our need to discontinue those anger responses that haven't been working for us thus far in particular situations and to step back and assess the true reasons for our anger. She then helps us think through realistic alternative responses. She supports our right to be angry and challenges us to avoid considering our anger as being either wrong or inappropriate. If we're angry, we're angry. We just need to do something productive with it as, properly channeled, the emotional energy we possess when angry could help drive us to make major positive changes in our life. I am going through an ugly divorce and I now recognize that both my and my husband's inability to effectively handle anger was a key contributing factor to our failed marriage. Though it is too late for my own marriage, I'm giving this book to my daughter, who I often see repeating in her own marriage some of the poor anger responses she learned at home. The alternative responses do work, though they aren't easy to remember in heated situations. It will take a concerted effort to \"practice\" appropriate anger responses until they become second nature. But it's worth the effort as I have already seen positive change occur in several of my relationships. This was a great \"AHA\" book for me. I understand so much more about my own anger now than I ever have and am prepared to manage it in a way that will most likely blow my family members away!"

We all do these &quot;dances&quot; she speaks of all the time, I don't care if you are a woman or a man.  It doesn't have to be a husband/wife relationship either, it happens in all relationships.  Her theory is sound and true and can very well help you to end these &quot;dances&quot; (fights/problems) you have with other people.  It was *very* enlightening to see what we do actually spelled out for us because so much we do we do without realizing or giving 2nd thought to.<p>Read this book from beginning to end before trying this stuff.  Secondly, keep in mind one very important thing...as much as you can change your attitude, others can change theirs and not always in the direction you hope they will.  Her methods do work, but you must be prepared in some instances to &quot;let go&quot; of people that cause you strife if you plan to try to change these &quot;dances&quot; with whom ever you do this with.  The reason is that maybe you don't want to let go of your mother or your friend or who ever, but they might want to let &quot;you&quot; go because they don't like the change.  Now, she tells you that in the book anyway, but just ready yourself for it.  I had a few friends that I either let go or they let me go and now I am feeling a little excluded.  Sure, there are no more fights or &quot;bad times&quot; but that let go of the good too.  I couldn't get an in-between.  Mind you, this worked WONDERS with some other people I tried it on and actually solidified the relationships more.  Just be prepared that you win some, you lose some...you can't change people to follow this &quot;new&quot; dance if they don't want to and it is always hard to let go."

Women either through conditioning or habit tend to react with anger or tears of frustration. Nothing is resolved.  Harriet Lerner offers an alternative solution. <p>The major point that Harriet Lerner resoundedly drives home is that we will not change the other person, but we can change how we interact with them.  We can break this cycle or dance by learning new steps.  Thus, The Dance of Anger is about communication.

I could pick holes in the theories of Dale Carnegie and Norman Vincent Peale but my judgment would be over-ruled by the fact that millions bought their books and found them helpful.		The marketplace has judged Harriet Lerner favorably.  I must also say that she is an excellent writer. So now let me pick some holes, which may be completely irrelevant to the many people who have found her work useful and enjoyable.		She has two slightly contradictory basic premises, one feminist and one psychodynamic. The first is that women are not very good at being angry because society does not allow women's  anger to be effective.  The second is essentially psychoanalytic (although her stated theoretical base is the theories of Murray Bowen). The anger of the women she describes in her case vignettes is accounted for by the mental mechanisms (derived from Anna Freud's \"The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense\") of displacement and projection.  These women are not being angry at the right people.		The families she describes are not in very extreme situations.  There is no physical violence, no guns or jail time, no cocaine or alcoholism, no rape or incest (and surprisingly little about sex).  This may make it more relevant for a lot of people but less relevant for many of those whose daily lives are affected by anger."
"10.2307/25762901","Changing Relationships","006074104X","The Dance of Anger by Dr. Harriet Lerner, Kindle Version	A BOOK REPORT BY REV. DR. JUDE ARNOLD	I was happy to find the eBook version of Dr. Lerner's 1970's classic.  I'm finding writing my first review of an eBook much more challenging, tho.  Dr. Lerner, a champion in women's psychology, offers us this awesome self help around anger.  I begin with the Epilogue in which Dr. Lerner talks about what she means by self help.	\"'Defining a self' or `becoming  one's  own person' is a task that one ultimately does alone....In the end, I define what I think, feel and believe....Yet, this lonely and challenging task cannot be accomplished in isolation.  We can only accomplish it through our connectedness with others and the new learning about ourselves our relationships provide.\"(Italics and Underlining throughout are Dr. Lerner's.)	In her books Dr. Learner always stresses \"the importance of learning about the experience of family members and sharing our own.\"  She also adds her belief that it's \"equally crucial for us to connect with the family of womankind....This book [is] about personal anger and personal change, but as feminism has taught us, `the personal is political.' This means that there is a circular connection between the patterns of our intimate relationships and the degree to which women are represented, valued, and empowered in every aspect of society and culture....  \"It is not sufficient for individual women to learn to move differently in personal relationships.  If we do not also challenge and change the societal institutions that keep women in a subordinate and de-selfed position outside the home, what goes on inside the home will continue to be problematic for us all....Whether the problem we face is a marital battle or the escalating nuclear arms race, women and men both have a long legacy of blaming people rather than understanding patterns.  Our challenge is to listen carefully to our own anger and use it in the service of change - while we hold tight to all that is valuable in our female heritage and tradition.\"	Dr. Lerner wrote The Dance of Anger \"to help readers not only identify the true sources of their anger, but also to learn how to change the patterns from which anger springs....The challenge of anger is at the heart of our struggle to achieve intimacy, self-esteem, and joy.  Learning how to deal with it is worth the journey, even though there are no six-easy-steps to personal fulfillment and relationship bliss.  The Dance of Anger teaches readers to understand how relationships operate and how to change our part in them.  It encourages readers to go the hard route.\"	Anger is a signal that \"can motivate us to say `no' to the ways in which we are defined by others and `yes' to the dictates of our inner self.  Women, however, have long been discouraged {and condemned} for the awareness and forthright expression of anger....The taboos against our feeling and expressing anger are so powerful that even knowing when we are angry is not a simple matter.  When a woman shows her anger, she is likely to be dismissed as irrational or worse....  \"Why are angry women so threatening to others?  If we are guilty, depressed, or self-doubting we stay in place.  We do not take action except against our own selves and we are unlikely to be agents of personal and social change.  In contrast, angry women may change and challenge the lives of us all, as witnessed by the past decade of feminism.\"  (I believe she refers, unfortunately, to the 1960's here.)	\"Anger is something we feel.  It exists for a reason and always deserves our respect and attention.  We all have a right to everything we feel - and certainly our anger is no exception....Our anger signals a problem, but provides us with no answers - not even a clue - as to how to solve it.\"  Dr. Lerner does not however advocate venting anger or letting it all hang out.  \"Feelings of depression, low self-esteem, self-betrayal, and even self-hatred are inevitable when we fight but continue to submit to unfair circumstances, when we complain but live in a way that betrays our hopes, values and potentials....Those of us who are locked into ineffective expressions of anger suffer as deeply as those of us who dare not get angry at all.\"	Dr. Lerner defines two styles of managing anger, the nice lady who avoids anger and conflict at all cost, and the bitch who is easily angered and fights with no constructive resolution.  In reality, both these styles \"serve equally well to protect others, to blur our clarity of self, and to ensure that change does not occur....Anger is inevitable when [nice ladies'] lives consist of giving in and going along; when we assume responsibility for other people's feelings and reactions; when we relinquish our primary responsibility to proceed with our own growth and ensure the quality of our own lives; when we behave as if having a relationship is more important than having a self....Nothing, but nothing, will block the awareness of anger so effectively as guilt and self-doubt.  Our society cultivates guilt feelings in women such that many of us still feel guilty if we are anything less than an emotional service station to others.\"  On the other hand, the nature of the hysterical bitch's \"fighting or angry accusations may actually allow the other person to get off the hook\" protecting old familiar patterns as surely as does silence.  The end result in both these styles is we end up feeling powerless.  Our self-esteem suffers because we have not addressed the real issues causing our anger.	It is in our first family relationships that closeness often leads to stuckness.  Dr. Lerner teaches us to use our anger energy to get unstuck in our stickiest relationships first, so these same issues will not fuel the fires in all of our other relationships.  \"The ability to use anger as a tool for change requires that we gain a deeper understanding and knowledge of how relationships operate....unresolved issues from our past inevitably surface in our current relationships.\"  We simply must learn to use our anger to change our own patterns of relating rather than blame and try to change other people.	Dr. Lerner identifies these four areas we need to learn to develop our skills and to use our anger as a tool for change in relationships:  \"1. We Can Learn to Tune In to the True Sources of Our Anger and Clarify Where We Stand.  \"2. We Can Learn Communications Skills.  \"3. We Can Learn to Observe and Interrupt Nonproductive Patterns of Interaction....We cannot make another person change his or her steps to an old dance, but if we change our own steps, the dance no longer can continue in the same predictable pattern.  \"4. We Can Learn to Anticipate and Deal with Countermoves and `Change Back!' Reactions from Others....In all families there is a powerful opposition to one member defining a more independent self...The powerful emotional counterforce (`You're wrong'; `Change back!' `Or else....') is predictable, understandable, and to some extent, universal.\"	Dr. Lerner adds, \"It is never easy to move away from silent submission or ineffective fighting toward a calm but firm assertion of who we are, where we stand, what we want, and what is and is not acceptable to us....Not only can we acquire new ways of managing old angers; we can also gain a clearer and stronger `I' and with it, the capacity for a more intimate and gratifying `we.'  Many of our problems with anger occur when we choose between having a relationship and having a self.  This book is about having both.....If two people become one, a separation can feel like a psychological or a physical death.  We may have nothing - not even a self to fall back on - when an important relationships ends.  We all need to have both an `I' and a `we' that nourish and give meaning to each other....The more we carve out a clear and separate `I', the more we can experience and enjoy both intimacy and aloneness.\"	Dr. Lerner demonstrates that  all, and especially romantic, relationships can be like a seesaw; \"the underfunctioning of one individual allows for the overfunctioning of the other....The more the man [i.e.] avoids sharing his own weaknesses, neediness, and vulnerability, the more his woman may experience and express more than her share.  The more the woman avoids showing her competence and strength, the more her man will have an inflated sense of his own. And if the underfunctioning partner starts looking better, the overfunctioning partner will start looking worse....If the woman is further convinced that she herself cannot survive without the relationship, she will vent her anger in a manner that only reinforces the old familiar patterns from which her anger stems....  \"Whenever one person makes a move to rebalance the seesaw, there is a countermove by the other party.  There are few things more anxiety-arousing than shifting to a higher level of self-assertion and separateness in an important relationship and maintaining the position despite the countermoves of the other person....Countermoves are the other person's unconscious attempt to restore a relationship to its previous balance or equilibrium, when anxiety about separateness and change gets too high....What matters is the degree to which we are able to take a clear position in a relationship and behave in ways that are congruent with our stated beliefs....The woman who sits at the bottom of a seesaw marriage accumulates a great amount of rage, which is in direct proportion to the degree of her submission and sacrifice....Sometimes, to develop a stronger `I' is to come to terms with our deep-seated wish to leave an unsatisfactory marriage and this possibility may be no less frightening than the fear of being left.\"	Dr. Learners covers the subject of triangles in great depth. \"Identifying the real issues is not an easy matter.  It is particularly difficult among family members because when two adults have a conflict, they often bring in a third party to form a triangle, which then makes it even harder for the two people involved to identify and work out their problems.... Underground issues from one relationship or context invariably fuel our fires in another.\" We detour \"feelings of anger from one person to another....We reduce anxiety in one relationship by focusing on a third party, who we unconsciously pull into the situation to lower the emotional intensity in the original pair. Triangles can become rigidly entrenched blocking the growth of the individuals in them and keeping us from identifying the actual sources of conflict in our relationships....Triangles greatly increase the probability of escalating aggression....The three essential ingredients of extricating oneself from a triangle are: staying calm, staying out, and hanging in.\"  It is never helpful to anyone to gossip or talk about a third party. \"In the best of all possible worlds we might envision separate person-to-person relationships with our friends, coworkers, and family members that were not excessively influenced by other relationships.\"	Most of us put our anger energy into trying to change the other person.  This, Dr. Lerner repeatedly exclaims, is impossible.  We \"secretly believe that we have the corner on the `truth' and that this would be a much better world if everyone else believed and reacted exactly as we do.  But one of the hallmarks of emotional maturity is to recognize the validity of multiple realities and to understand that people think, feel, and react differently.\"  Closeness does not mean sameness.  \"We have a right to everything we think and feel - and so does everyone else.  It is our job to state our thoughts and feelings clearly and to make responsible decisions that are congruent with our values and beliefs.  It is not our job to make another person think and feel the way we do or the way we want them to.... We are able to move away from ineffective fighting only when we give up the fantasy that we can change or control another person. It is only then that we can reclaim the power that is truly ours - the power to change our own selves and take new and different actions on our own behalf.\"	Dr. Lerner gives example after example illustrating these same basic lessons:  \"First, `letting it all hang out' may not be helpful because venting anger may protect rather than challenge the old rules and patterns in a relationship.  Second, the only person we can change and control is our own self.  Third, changing our own self can feel so threatening and difficult that it is often easier to continue an old pattern of silent withdrawal or ineffective fighting and blaming.  And, finally, de-selfing is at the heart of our most serious anger problems.\"	\"Even rats in a maze learn to vary their behavior if they keep hitting a dead end.  Why in the world, then, do we behave less intelligently than laboratory animals?  Repeating the same old fights protects us from the anxieties we are bound to experience when we make a change....Human nature is such that when we are angry, we tend to become so emotionally reactive to what the other person is doing to us that we lose our ability to observe our own part in the interaction....Self-observation is the process of seeing the interaction of ourselves and others, and recognizing that the ways other people behave with us has something to do with the way we behave with them.\"  The form of this circular dance is universal in which the behavior of each serves \"to maintain and provoke the other.  Once a part of an established twosome - married or unmarried, lesbian or straight - the more each person tries to change things, the more things stay the same.\"	I am beginning to understand how my interaction had become a circular dance in which my behavior maintained and provoked behavior in my significant other.  \"In the final analysis it matters little who started it.... A good way to make this break is to recognize the part we play in maintaining and provoking the other person's behavior.  Even if we are convinced that the other person is ninety-seven percent to blame we are still in control of changing our three percent.\"  Bottom line - \"We do not have the power to change another person who does not want to change, and our attempts to do so may actually protect him or her from change.  This is the paradox of the circular dances in which we all participate.\"	\"Opposites do attract, but they do not always live happily ever after.  On the one hand, it is reassuring to live with someone who will express parts of one's own self that one is afraid to acknowledge; yet, the arrangement has its inevitable costs:  The woman [i.e.]who is expressing feelings not only for herself but also for her husband will indeed end up behaving `hysterically' and `irrationally.'  The man who relies on his wife to do the `feeling work' for him will increasingly lose touch with this important part of himself, \"and when the time comes that he needs to draw upon his emotional resources, he may find that nobody's at home....This is the `masculinity' that our society breeds - the male who feels at home in the world of things and abstract ideas but who has little empathic connection to others , little attunement to his own internal world, and little willingness or capacity to `hang in' when a relationship becomes conflicted and stressful... . Doing the `feeling work' like cleaning up has long been defined as `woman's work', and lots of women are good at it.  As with cleaning up, men will not begin to do their shares until women no longer do it for them.\"	\"When a woman vents her anger ineffectively or expresses it in an overemotional style, she does not threaten her man.  If anything she helps him maintain his masculine cool, while she herself is perceived as infantile or irrational.  When a woman clarifies the issue and uses her anger to move toward something new and different, the change occurs.  If she stops over-functioning [overinvolvement] for others and starts acting for herself, her underfunctioning [underinvolvement] man is likely to acknowledge and deal with his own anxieties.\"	Dr. Lerner goes on to identify two other types of dancers:  \"Emotional pursuers are persons who reduce their anxiety by sharing feelings and seeking close emotional contact.  Emotional distancers are persons who reduce their anxiety by intellectualizing and withdrawing.\"  No matter the problem, these two styles of responding to stress eventually become at odds. The common outcome of this classic scenario is that \"after the escalating dance of pursuit and withdrawal proceeds for some time, the woman [most often the pursuer] goes into what therapists call `reactive distance', which only temporarily reverses the pursuit cycle or has little effect at all....When a pursuer stops pursuing and begins to put her energy back into her own life - without distancing or expressing anger at the other person - the circular dance has been broken....A relationship becomes more `true' and balanced as the pursuer can allow herself to acknowledge and express more of her own wish for independence and space, and in turn, the distancer can begin to acknowledge more of his dependency and wish for closeness.\"	She repeats again, \"Changing another person is a solution that never, ever works.\"  The power that is ours is only and always the power to change our own self.  The only real power we have is the power to act and make choices.  However, to try to change the other person is usually the first thing we do with our anger.  The second thing we do is cut ourselves off either emotionally or geographically.  Such distancing does bring short-term relief but there are long term costs - \"the unresolved emotional intensity is likely to get played out in other important relationships....When emotional intensity is high in a family, most of us put the entire responsibility for poor communication on the other person....Always, we perceive that it is the other who prevents us from speaking and keeps the relationship from changing.  We disown our own part in the interactions we complain of and, with it, our power to bring about a change.\"	OK! What do we do instead of trying to change the other person or their thoughts and feelings?  We clearly state our beliefs and convictions and we stand behind them. This includes identifying within ourselves the true source of our anger, usually our independence from that person.  As we become less scared and guilty about showing our own strong and separate selves, in a mature and responsible fashion, we become more ready to make a change in the relationship, a change to being a separate and different person with our own unique way of being in the world.  With this change comes the experience of separation anxiety, most often \"based on an underlying discomfort with separateness and individuality that has its roots in our early family experience, where the unspoken expectation may have been that we keep a lid on our expressions of self.\"	\"Hit and Run confrontation does not lead to lasting change.... If serious about change, she must show for her own sake as well as the other that at last she is declaring her separateness and independence, but she is not declaring a lack of caring or closeness.  Independence means that we clearly define our own selves on emotionally important issues, but it does not mean emotional distance....The work of negotiating greater independence may be so fraught with mutual anxieties about rejection and loss that the person making the move must be responsible for maintaining emotional contact with the other.\"  Success will rest on her ability to share something about herself in a straightforward, nonblaming way while maintaining emotional contact throughout the process.  It requires also that she \"uphold her position with persistence and calm, without getting emotionally buffeted about by the inevitable countermoves and `change back!' reactions we meet whenever we assume a more autonomous position in an important relationship. This is what achieving selfhood and independence is all about. And it requires, among other things a particular way of talking and a degree of clarity that are especially difficult to achieve when we are angry.\"	Another important technique that Dr. Lerner teaches is to turn anger into an \"I message,\" a nonblaming statement about one's own self. She emphasizes that \"if our goal is to break a pattern in an important relationship and/or to develop a strong sense of self that we can bring to all our relationships, it is essential that we learn to translate our anger into clear, nonblaming statements about our own self .... The significant issue for women is that we may not have a clear `I' to communicate about and we are not prepared to handle the intense negative reactions that come our way when we do begin  to define and assert the self....Women often fear that having a clear `I' means threatening a relationship or losing an important person.  Thus, rather than using our anger as a challenge to think more clearly about the `I' in our relationships we may, when angry, actually blur what personal clarity we do have.\"	We really fear rocking the boat.  \"Feeling fuzzy-headed, inarticulate, and not so smart are common reactions experienced by women as we struggle to take a stand on our own behalf.  It is not just anger and fighting that we learn to fear; we avoid asking precise questions and making clear statements when we unconsciously suspect that doing so would expose our differences, make the other person feel uncomfortable, and leave us standing alone.\"	\"Why would any of us attempt to deny our anger and sacrifice one of our most precious possessions - our personal clarity?\"  For one thing, \"our very definitions of `masculinity' and `femininity' are based on the notion that women must function as nonthreatening helpmates and ego builders to men lest men feel castrated and weakened.\"  This explains when a woman's anger turns to tears; she's attempting to restore togetherness.  Instead she probably needs to work harder at the task of clarifying her separateness and independence within her first family. She cannot control the other person's reaction.  She should not allow herself to be controlled by them either.  \"She can simply stay on course by listening to what they have to say and then restating her initial position. There is nothing wrong with \"sounding like a broken record now and then.... She cannot change the other person's mind or ensure that justice will prevail.  She can state her position, recognize her choices, and make responsible decisions on her own behalf.\"	\"Our problem is not the fear of clarity but the absence of it.  That we are angry is obvious.  But we may have little perspective on the `I,' as a result of focusing exclusively on what the other person is doing to us.... Using our anger as a starting point to become more knowledgeable about the self does not require that we analyze ourselves and provide lengthy psychologically explanations of our reactions....Anger is a tool for change when it challenges us to become more of an expert on the self and less of an expert on others.  Learning to use our anger effectively requires some letting go - letting go of blaming that other person whom we see as causing our problems and failing to provide for our happiness; letting go of the notion that it is our job to change other people or tell them how they should think, feel, behave. Yet, this does not mean that we passively accept or go along with any behavior.  In fact, a `live-and-let-live' attitude can signal a de-selfed position, if we fail to clarify what is and is not acceptable or desirable to us in a relationship.  The main issue is how we clarify our position....We can simply say, `well, it may seem crazy or irrational to you, but this is the way I see it.'  Of course, there is never a guarantee that other people will alter their behavior\" to suit you and me.	Dr. Lerner also counsels to not be in a hurry with this.  It's ok to be uncertain.  Sit with it for a while!  She says, \"Slow Down!  Our anger can be a powerful vehicle for personal growth and change if it does nothing more than help us recognize that we are not yet clear about something.\"  What most of us do when we are angry is judge, blame, criticize, moralize, preach, instruct, interpret, and psychoanalyze. She goes on to say, \"If I persist in repeating this point, it is because it is an extremely difficult concept to grasp, and hold on to when we are angry.  Conflicting wants and different perceptions of the world do not mean that one party is `right' and the other `wrong.'\"	Some common communication mistakes we make are, for starters \"not being particularly tactful and strategic.  Few people are able to listen well when they are being criticized or told what's wrong with them.\"  Second, we communicate as if to convey that we are an expert on the other person's experience.  \"'Who has the problem?' is a question that has nothing to do with guilt or culpability.  The one who has the problem is simply the party who is dissatisfied with or troubled by the particular situation....How many of us can distinguish with confidence where our responsibilities to others begin and end? How can women trained from birth to define ourselves through our loving care of others - know with confidence when it is time to finally say `Enough!'?\" Many woman devote themselves so exclusively to the needs of others that they betray if not lose themselves.	\"If however, we do not use our anger to define ourselves clearly in every important relationship we are in - and manage our feelings as they arise - no one else will assume this responsibility for us.  We are never the first in our family to wrestle with a problem although it may feel that way.  All of us inherit the unsolved problems of our past....We put our energy into taking responsibility for other people's feelings, thoughts and behavior and hand  over to others responsibility for our own. When this happens, it becomes difficult, if not impossible for the old rules of a relationship to change....As we learn to \"relinquish responsibility for the self, we are prone to blame others for failing to fill up our emptiness or provide for our happiness - which is not their job.\"  It is however our job to \"allow others the space to manage their own pain and solve their own problems. When we do not put our primary emotional energy into solving our own problems, we take on other people's problems as our own.  When we overfunction for another individual, we end up very angry and in the process, we facilitate the growth of no one.\"  We must \"acknowledge that we do not have the answers or solutions to other people's problems.\" Even with children, \"Change comes about when we stop trying to shape up the other person and begin to observe patterns and find new options for our own behavior.\"	In closing, I'd like to thank Dr. Lerner for her tremendous contribution to women's psychology and my emotional health, and for this \"review of some basic do's and don'ts to keep in mind when you are feeling angry.  \"1. Do speak up when an issue is important to you.  \"2. Don't strike while the iron is hot.  \"3. Do take time out to think about the problem and to clarify your position.  \"4. Don't use `below-the-belt' tactics.  \"5. Do speak in `I' language.  \"6. Don't make vague requests.  \"7. Do try to appreciate the fact that people are different.  \"8. Don't participate in intellectual arguments that go nowhere.  \"9. Do recognize that each person is responsible for his or her own behavior.  \"10. Don't tell another person what she or he thinks or feels or `should' think or feel.  Remember that  one person's right to be angry does not mean that the other person is to blame.  \"11. Do try to avoid speaking through a third party.  \"12. Don't expect change to come about from hit-and-run confrontations.\""
"10.1086/655749","The Masters and the Slaves","0394435613","Freyre's Masters and Slaves forms what is considered by many to be a trilogy of books published in the 1930's that revolutionized Brazilian Studies. The other are two books,[by other authors]... Freyre, the most popular and readable of the three, was a Pernambucano (from the sugar cane regions around Recife) and often blurs the distinction between Brazil as a whole and sugar-cane regions of Brazil. His methodology reflects his education, a US oriented 1930's anthropological perspective (he was a student of Franz Boas). This book in particular treats a very specific historical event: the development of a sugar-based agricultural economy in late 1500s, early 1600s in northeastern coastal Brazil. The book makes the generalization that Brazilian culture as a whole evolved from this cultural base, and places little importance on the parallel development of cattle-based cultures in the northeastern interior or the primitive jungle trading activities of Sao Paulo's city fathers (Raposo Tavares, etc). <p>Because of its focus on a very provincial-specific economy and culture, I would criticize Freyre for offering a very incomplete study of \"Brazilian Civilization\" in this book. In his defense, however, this book is too often read as a stand-alone study, when in fact Freyre intended for it to form a trilogy with another two books...The former traces how the rural sugar-based culture of early northeastern Brazil affected and was affected by the emergence of cities and urban life-patterns in places like Recife, Salvador, and Rio de Janeiro in the mid 1600s through the end of the 18th century. The latter book follows the study further, through the independence period and especially the twilight of the Empire, establishment of the Republic in the 188o's. If you read one, I recommend all three books to appreciate Freyre's thesis, that the original sugar-culture that developed and was discussed in Masters and Slaves had a lasting impact on Brazil's evolution as a whole, even in areas and regions where sugar cane and slavery were never established bases for economic development. This vision of Brazil remains incomplete without an understanding of Sao Paulo and the south, a region which today is arguably the strongest center of influence in the country. To complete that, I would recommend some books by [other authors]"
"10.1086/655749","The Masters and the Slaves","0394435613","Gilberto Freyre is now considered one of the grestest thinkers of Brazil, alongside S&eacute;rgio Buarque de Hollanda. As mrs. Laidman recognized, we can't look for his work as if it's been written yesterday: when many people all over Americas (both North and South) believed that &quot;whitening population&quot; was the solution to all problems; when fascists and nazis took power in Europe, Freyre looked at mixture of races and saw it as a positive feature, something that could lead our people to a better place, God knows where, but better. During the 60's and 70's his ideas were fiercely attacked by new generations of sociologists and historians - and that's good, that's how science advances. But, they attacked him, mostly, for his political positions. Today, people rediscovered Freyre, understood him on his own time. Yes, his presumptions about sex addicted people, indian women burning in desire and so on are considered today too much. But the essence, the mix of races and cultures as a positive fact, the understanding of Portuguese government as something absent and masters of plantions, on the absence of State, rulling their slaves and families and regions, masters as the actual power in colonial Brazil, is considered a remarkable way to understand our country and it's people. By the way, many people in Black Movement also recognizes Freyre and his role in understand Brazil's black influences. Despite his presumptions, Freyre is more up to date than ever."

Freyre brings to History black people's contributions:  culturally, genetically. Most of all, underlines that brazilians are a mix  of cultures and races, not a pure race, and it is a positive feature for as  all."

However, not all of what is written should be taken at face value.  <p>The book was written more than  50 years ago and Freyre, like any other historian or ethnologist,  unavoidably comes to the table with cultural and personal biases  transparent to himself.<p>Freyre makes a number of presumptions, sometimes  contradictory, sometimes a bit absurd from today's perspective, about the  sexual attributes, habits and dispositions of the Amerindians, peoples of  African descent and the Portuguese.  Portuguese men are categorized as  oversexed (over and over again), Amerindian women as ever willing sexual  partners while the Africans are determined to be less sexual because they  use music and dancing to stimulate their sexual urges (!).  Then, just to  confuse the reader, Freyre talks about Africans escaping to the Brazilian  bush and `raping' the (ever willing?) Amerindian woman.  Did these alleged  rapists bring their drummers with them?  All three groups can step forward  and take offense at Freyre's presumptions.<p>In the year 2000 we would  interpret Freyre's presumptions as racist, but we have the benefit of  hindsight and he didn't.  In his time he would have been considered forward  looking and anything but a racist.

He deals with race, climate, agronomy, sexual habits, architecture, the arts, religion, sorcery, literature, history, food, economics, politics, and the thousand other forces that made the Brazil of today what it is.

I found the book to deepen my perspective on the way caste division, originating out of the original gentile social division of work, where people worked in all branches of work,came to be of a caste nature. The author connects caste division to both racial and class division and the conquest of national groups. I found the footnotes to be, not just a pleasure to read, but thought provoking and contributing to the authors text. This book is a good read for anyone interested in human historical evolution and in Marxist analysis of history. Cox's book is very much a treasure, and overlooked, but should not be. A good student of Cox should be able to take his thinking to a higher level, to see how caste ideas control all national divisions of the human race.

"10.1086/654745","Eros and Civilization","0807015555","So I'm the first one to tackle this one ?!? So be it: first published in 1955, &quot;Eros&quot; is a cornerstone of modern sociopolitical philosophy. It's a radical work, in the sense that Marcuse goes back to the  roots and undertakes the task of carrying Freudian theory to its  inescapable implications. (A task, by the way, set down by Herr Doktor  Professor himself; if your edition of the Britannica still has the text  originally written by Freud in 1926 for the &quot;psychoanalysis&quot;  entry, check out his statement that &quot;the future will probably  attribute far greater importance to psychoanalysis as the science of the  unconscious than as a therapeutic procedure&quot;.) As all true  masterpieces, &quot;Eros&quot; is not flawless: in the latter part of the  book, Marcuse falls into the trap of trying to describe / prescribe how a  society freed from repression would organize itself for the common good,  rather than self-destructing - and, of course, fumbles royally (a failure  he admitted to in his later works). No matter; unless you've read it,  you're like Dylan's Mr. Jones, and will have no inkling on how (and, most  importantly, why) capitalism reinvented itself from industrial back into  financial, much less on what the current &quot;global crisis&quot; is all  about. I dare suggest that &quot;Eros&quot; be read back-to-back with  Christopher Lasch's &quot;The Culture of Narcissism&quot;. In a strange  way, they complement each other"
"10.1086/654745","Eros and Civilization","0807015555","Herbert Marcuse's 'Eros and Civilization' is emblematic of the aspect of his work that integrates Freudian theory with Marxian doctrine. Although he primarily deals with Freud and the issue of society's use of repression (psychological and political) in the service of production, he deals with Marxist theory also when you read between the lines. The theme of alienation of labor is clearly one of the resounding and recurring notes in the symphony.	As a psychotherapist intimately acquainted with developments in psychoanalytic theory in the fifty odd years since Marcuse wrote, this project involves some perils as well as some rich veins of thought. To philosophize on the basis of a theory which is derived primarily from clinical work in which two individuals share in a closed setting is always dangerous. In addition, to take Freud's formulations for granted, and then proceed to apply them to social and political systems is a big stretch. I would say primarily that the main flaw in Marcuse's thesis is his acceptance of Thanatos, or the so-called death principle, which is no longer accepted by any school of psychoanalysis. Unfortunately, Freud's own tendency to speculate both in the fields of anthropology and metaphysics, does not help Marcuse any. If one studies Talcott Parsons and his brilliant work on social systems (The Social System) using social theory, one can see a great deal of resonance with Marcuse's analysis of repression as a cultural control mechanism.	To balance the equation, I believe Marcuse brings to surface themes which have been abandoned in modern social discourse through sheer inertia and the grinding power of the repressive culture. The description of the  role the inner agencies (i.e. the superego) play in integrating an individual into a particular society is a brilliant analysis. If our culture seemed \"successful\" as a consumer society then, the movement has only expanded to the point the culture in general has lost sight of how our citizens are enslaved by the very \"American dream\" we tell ourselves will bring happiness. The concept of an infinitely expanding economy, the measurement of the nation's well being by primarily economic and political indicators, the military displacement of aggression to an outside \"evil\" enemy, the frenzied pursuit of built-in obsolence have all metastasized, and Marcuse has put them to the microscope.	I would say that at a time when our country is having a resurgence of hope, Marcuse's work offers a very important analytic tool with which think about where we are and where we want to go as a people, and a void re-creating excessively repressive social structures."
"10.1086/654745","Eros and Civilization","0807015555","Marcuse's attempt to combine Marx and Freud, and his vision of a non-repressive civilization (as well as his views on phantasies, art, myths and even perversions as anticipiations of such a society) is one of the masterpieces of utopian thought. After reading it your daydreams will never be the same again. It is not an easy text: the first part is certainly dry at times, and presupposes some familiarity with Freud (it is useful to read his Civilization and its discontents along with Marcuse's text).  But the second part is truly of masterpiece. Anybody intesested in art, sexual liberation, ecology or psychoanalysis will find this essential reading. Far from being a rehash of Fromm, Marcuse accuses Fromm et. al. of removing the truly subversive elements from Freud. But read it, anf find out for yourself."

"10.1086/654745","Eros and Civilization","0807015555","Marcuse's \"Eros and Civilization\" lays the foundations for a major critique of the fundamental tenets of Freud's theory of the mind. The German philosopher demonstrates how Freud transformed what was essentially a psychology of society into a sociology of the mind. ('Freud's \"biologism\" is social theory in a depth dimension\"'). For Marcuse Freud's mistake was to see the repression of istincts not as a historically situated pheomenon due to particular (and therefore mutable) social conditions, but as an absolute given indispensable to the growth of civilization. Perhaps for reasons of expediency(Freud's ideas might have been still too influential in 1956 for an overt attack), Marcuse elaborates his counterargument that a non-repressive society IS possible within a Freudian framework. But the damage is done: once you read this book Freud's idea that repression is salutary and necessary for psychic development will look a lot more like what it was(late Victorian moralism) and much less like what it wasn't (science). For more along these lines try Rieff, Freud: the Mind and the Moralist."
"10.1086/654745","Eros and Civilization","0807015555","The most annoying feature of this book is the the continual use of the Freudian concepts of ego, Es, and so on... in the first part. To accept that, you really need to believe in the orthodox psychoanalytical theory, which maybe is a bit hard these days.	But Marcuse trascends the boundaries of psychoanalytical theory, and develops a range of arguments that stand on their own.	He thinks that society throughout History ha s been one huge repressive endeavour, accepted by the individuals because it allowed them to survive, even though it deprived  them of the possibility of happiness.	But nowadays, we should have reached the stage where  everyone's basic needs can be satisfied with a minimal amount of work; in fact, penury subsists only because those detaining power create it in order to justify their domination.	If everyone could free their libido, the Death instinct would disappear, because it exists only on the basis of the &quot;Nirvana principle&quot;(we desire destruction because death equalls with the quiet of complete satisfaction).	A porttrait of a society where everyone wouold be free to apply their libido to everyone else, and to engage in work in a way more akin to playing follows.	This sounds  bit distressing, especially the concept of &quot;jolly work&quot;, if I dare name it so. The most interesting parts are in fact the &quot;asides&quot;, where Marcuse explains how we imagine &quot;complete satisfaction&quot; always to reside in a past which our memory conserves as a token both of the oppression of the individual and of the human species, how art is limited by form, the existence of which defines it as something incapable of influence on reality, the way that philosophy since Plato has cooperated with oncoming Christianity to define &quot;Nirvana&quot; as finding itself substantially &quot;beyond&quot; our world etc..

For those interested in an anthropological approach to psychology-as-myth (the chapter on 'Origin of Repressive Civilization' is especially interesting not least because it is so very clearly wrong!) that more or less parallels a similar approach to myth and culture in the (somewhat contested) spirit of Frazer, De Santillana, Graves or even Weston this book will be of interest -- although I must say that anyone familiar with those authors will almost certainly be familiar with this one."

My 8 year old that I also homeschool loves baby stuff more than her own work.  I'm looking for something more her age that has sticker activities.

The stickers are NOT marked by page numbers, but the pages where the stickers should go have outlines of the sticker shapes.  Katie loved searching for the stickers that would fit the shapes.

It was also his first coloring book - another surprise - he's learning to draw in the lines and play with different colors.		My only problem with the book is that there are pictures of different things on the cover, like the rubber dinosaur and robot, which are not included inside the book, and he keeps on saying \"I want this one!\"		Overall, excellent book for toddlers."

In some instances, coverage of any one theorist and concepts crucial to understanding his or her work is startlingly brief.  George Herbert Mead, for example, is given only five pages to explain the structure of the self and the key role it plays in his social behaviorism.  Furthermore, while Lemert's own comments are learned and valuable, this is not the sort of book that provides well-developed concrete examples.  Beyond that, little attention in given to synthesizing the complementary efforts of disparate theorists.		While a useful book, this is the kind of text which invites misunderstanding and abuse.  Readers are unimpressed by the apparent shallowness of great thinkers who are given too little attention. Ill-tutored instructors are inclined to present material in a disconnected list-like fashion, without developing the ideas listed by Lemert.

"10.2307/40606169","Word origins and how we know them: Etymology for everyone","0195387074","This book makes one realize that there are two kinds of etymologies: the one that tries to explain terms like \"hackney\" and \"jack-o-lantern\"; and the one that tries to explain terms like \"hand\" and \"bring\". The first makes you search through medieval tomes and books about ancient crafts; the second causes one to delve into ablaut series and next to unpronounceable Proto-Indo-European (PIE) words that look more like formulas (which they partly are). The first yields a number of anecdotal and often amusing stories, the second dry-as-dust formal word derivations. The author, although acknowledging the existence of the second, is clearly much more interested in the first; PIE figures only sporadically in the text and does not even occur in the index.		This approach makes the book a juicy read, especially on \"funny\" English words; the sections on ablaut series etc. lack the same flourish and are mercifully small. Yet even in the juicy part there are quite a number of promising	paragraphs that lead nowhere. For example, on page 101 we learn that \"Cockney\" has an interesting origin, but that origin is never revealed.		Much too much to my taste is attributed to sound symbolism (page 212: the b in \"to beat\" is suggested to be \"imitative (echoic)\" of the beating action; the argument is that out of 115 synonyms of \"beat, strike\" about 20 begin with a b) or explained as \"baby words\" (pig - big - bag for \"swollen things\"). I think such claims are warranted only when supported by similar phenomena from several non-Indo-European languages. I personally cannot find back any of these sound symbolisms in Hebrew, the only Non-IE language I know well. Latin \"capere\" (to take), Finnish \"kappan\" (to seize) and Hebr. \"kaf\" (hollow hand) may very well be related (and I think they probably are) but I don't hear any sound symbolism in them (page 43). For that matter, Hebr. \"khataf\" (he grabbed) sounds much more like seizing.		The editing is far from perfect; one problem is that the Old-English/Icelandic letter \"thorn\" (a p with an upward stick like a b) is often printed as a p (f.e. page 83). In summary, the subtitle \"Etymology for Everybody\" is fully justified, but it is a limited form of etymology."

"10.2307/25677733","When the Light's Red","0865479542","What does one say about a beautifully written story that they gained nothing from? Rapp's style and dialogue are absurdly good, and yet I came away from this play with a pointless bleakness that I hadn't felt in some time.		Don't misunderstand me: I do not mind sad endings. The literary world is filled with masterpieces that resolve in tragedy: and for good reason. I, however, was unconvinced as to the hows and whys of Rapp's dirge-like ending.		Rapp's dialogue is terrific--I'll give him that. The words flow like mercury--he has done all actors a great service with his words. Magnificent performances come all too easily to actors who are given dialogue like that. We need more playwrights who can craft a turn of phrase the way Rapp can.		But all this adds up to nothing if the route the characters take seems pointless and melodramatic.		Red Light Winter starts out strong, quickly establishing the relationship between Matt and Davis: their differences, but certainly why they would spend time together. Their verbal and physical dance with Christina is interesting at first, and it was easy to see how Matt, alone in his head if not his actual life, could fall for Christina with the passion that he does. With Davis, however, I kept coming back to Rapp's introductory notes on the characters. Davis, he insisted, is in love with Christina as well, but tries to hide it due to Matt's feelings. Where this is evident, I am not sure. Davis (on paper, anyhow) does not come off as charming, witty, or even remotely believable as a man worth falling in love with (much less as a successful book editor).		By the time you start to notice the play slipping, it slides into melancholy and melodrama--my least favorite combination (well, except for pickles and milk). Davis, not content to just be an obnoxious \"friend\", reveals himself (inexplicably) to be a beast, capable of acts that a Nazi war criminal would politely decline. The sick (again: inexplicably) Christina shuffles away (presumably to kill herself), and we are left with the \"life is s***, grab a shovel\" tragic ending so popular with high schoolers and freshman English majors.		I'm going to go ahead and say it again: I do not mind sad endings. But this one comes so randomly out of left field that you can't help but roll your eyes until your head aches and your vision dims. Rapp is capable of much more and much better than this. As an audience, we at very least deserve an explanation. The dangers of sexual obsession? Sure--the theme's there. But the tragic payoff comes at such a jarring angle that you can't help but put down your script or your program and ask that age old question: What the hell was that?"
"10.2307/25677733","When the Light's Red","0865479542","I really loved this script, but anyone else I have lent it to hated it.  :)		It's a pretty brutal, sick look at humanity.

"10.2307/25677733","When the Light's Red","0865479542","Typical grunge and shock value playwriting, substituting nudity, sex and drugs for storytelling or character development.  Don't get me wrong, I've got nothing against sex and drugs on stage- if anything we need more of it.  But that doesn't change this from being and underdeveloped narative that starts nowhere, goes nowhere, and seems to be written more as an excersise in stream of consciousness.  Vague notions of \"love\" are tossed about, people behave in ways no one would ever behave in order to pad the length and create a sense of manufactured depth.  \"Important things must be happening, look how strange everyone is behaving!\"  Ugh.		Still, it could be excellent fodder for students, some decent scene work to be pulled from it, maybe a monologue or two.  All in all, I don't see any real reason to put this onstage unless you're looking for an excuse to be naked on stage.  For that try Alan Bowne, Sam Shepard or John Patrick Shanley; vastly superior authors with vastly superior plays."

It is pretty straitforward realism, with a fairly interesting story set-up: 2 young American friends, traveling around Amsterdam together, both get attracted to the same woman.  She only likes one of them - arrogant, entertaining, hotshot Davis, who has no intention of taking her seriously.  Lonely, melancholy playwright Matt might really appreciate her, but he does not turn her on.  The girl is a French prostitute who is quiet and sweet and apparently looking for a cool American boyfriend.  The dialogue is not very interesting, pretty standard college guy talk.  I got bored after 10-15 pages and skipped to the end.  It was not terrible, but if this is the best he has got, then Adam Rapp is not on his way to being the next Albee or Miller."

Tannen shows that repetition of key pieces of a speaker's utterance are useful in a variety  of ways: they maintain a topic, allow turn-taking which supports the  story-teller, and reinforce a speaker's point. She also demonstrates how  repetition and other cooperative strategies help conversational partners  negotiate meaning together."
"10.2307/20622715","Talking Voices: Repetition, Dialogue, and Imagery in Conversational Discourse","0521868904","I've read all of Dr. Tannen's books, and \"Tannen fans\" love to quip that we wish we could bring her along to business and social functions to let us know what's really going on beneath our conversations! Of all the things she's been called, perhaps the most accurate is a translator-- par excellance. While all of Deb's books are \"user friendly\" and have immense value for dialogue in important relationships like our jobs, marriages, loves, friends... etc., the present volume is her \"academic opus,\" containing many of the foundational premises for her never ending astuteness when it comes to linguistics. Time after time Tannen nails the deep undercurrents of semiotics, syntax, and especially context. She's now written about sisters and sisters, significant others, men and women, kids and parents, and cultural differences. But I've always been anxious for a \"deeper read,\" since we all sense she has some natural gift for seeing many levels down in conversation analysis in addition to her linguistic training. Although Talking Voices focuses on reported dialog, political speeches, repetitive structures in different contexts, etc. in a very deeply nuanced and tightly researched referenced fashion, Doc Tannen also manages to convey her wonderful insights with her usual down to earth, example-filled brillance, keeping us moving along like the book was a page turner rather than a deep exploration of linguistic structures.		Topics include constructed dialog (making the very relevant point that NO reportage of a dialogue is EVER accurate because subtle contextual differences exponentially change meaning), scenes and music, sound and senses, repetition in many forms with numerous underlying strategies, imitation, storytelling, the function of detail, the functions of verbal image creation, and much more. At the end, Tannen proposes the possiblity of a more \"humanistic linguistics.\" Her idea is, using the success of literary linguistic models of involvement, to create a linguistic analysis frame that allows for beauty, art and other \"soulful\" aspects of dialogue. Given the move of linguistics into text processors, algorithms, affective programming and other machine interfaces, her proposal is nothing short of \"the lion lying down with the lamb.\" Not a self help book, but full of insights on every page just like her other books, giving us a peek into her deeper analytic currents. Instead of bringing out a bunch of \"big guns\" in the form of esoteric jargon, she takes her own advice about humanity and keeps the analysis within the reach of us mortals who haven't spent a lifetime on the jargon. This doesn't take away one ounce from the depth or value. Highly recommended for all who seek insights into why and how we say and think as we do. Keep your muse, Deb, and thanks for not \"writing down\" to us."

After reading \"Presumed Innocent,\" which I consider one of the genre-breaking books in crime fiction during the past 20 years, I turned to this.  The beginning starts off brilliantly as the first chapter is the perfect mix of pathos and plot setting.  Everything, however, goes down hill from there.  A self-pitying (sexist) protagonist, aimless flashbacks, odd occurrences (and re-occurrences) by weak characters, and a plot that is convoluted (and seriously dated by today's financial standards), the book grows increasingly painful until the final page.  Upon completing the work, I set it down, not with satisfaction, but with disgust at having wasted so much time.  I gave it two stars instead of one probably because I admired Turow's first book so much that I wished this had been a better reading experience."

I was very glad that I did.  Once I got into the subplots, I found it hard to put down.  The subplots went a little too far in my opinion, but it made for a very interesting story."

However, unless you are into finance, the market, and other areas such as these, most of the book will be dry and hard to get through.  It was for me.  The thing that kept me going was Sandy's continuing search to find out what was going on with his wife.  As I said, the book didn't exactly have me glued to it, but it wasn't bad, either."
"10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.87","Burden of Proof","B006Z2YK5S","In most of his novels, Scott Turow enjoys mixing several plotlines, the past and the present, and the internal worlds of several characters, and almost always makes it enjoyable or at least intriguing for his readers. Unfortunately, in this book he ends up tripping over his own complications, to the extent that the story becomes boring and hard to follow. In an overzealous attempt to create more plot twists as the story develops, Turow throws out new discoveries about his characters that after a while become too contradictory to be plausible.		Possibly the book's greatest failure is its insufficient development of its central character, Alejandro \"Sandy\" Stern. His cultural background (born and raised in Argentina, with parents who fled Eastern Europe ahead of the Holocaust) and experience as an immigrant who enters the local elite through the law is barely glossed over (a frequent failing of American authors: insufficient research of or insight into the non-American experience), while his sexual adventures and romantic self-exploration after his wife's death can be interesting but receive more than their fair share of pages. In addition, the widower who realizes after his wife's death that he barely really knew her is a clich&eacute;; Stern's relationship with his wife is also insufficiently explored.		Turow has developed several high-quality novels with some of the characters who are also present in this book, but here his effort to create a further story about his characters comes across as more of a forced effort than an engaging story and eventually falls under the weight of its world-weary cynicism. He definitely can provide better reading material and has done so many times."

This author will not appeal to everyone, in spite of the popularity of Presumed Innocent. If you are expecting JUST legal thrills, look elsewhere.

I like both writers but if you want something that goes deeper; go with Turow.  Grisham has good plots but his characters are often weak.  Turow has good plots and interesting characters.  The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was becuase I feel Turow goes a bit overboard with the verbiage and the reader gets the feeling he wants to show that he is the master of the dictionary."

But I would submit this bit of unsolicited commentary: Sometimes wanting is that elusive quality which rivets the reader's eyes to the book, well past The Late Show :  Burden of Proof is a sort of plodding read, page by page (though it does -  ever so gradually - gain momentum).<p>One wonders how a young author can  seemingly incorporate the perception of age, wisdom and experience in his  characters to the degree that Turow has. As brilliant as his multi-tiered  allegories are, I miss the slight but frequent spreckles of humor that I've  seen in some other good novels.  This, by no means the principal requisite  to greatness, is nonetheless a trait I've really come to admire in some of  the other authors.

However, with this book, you really get to understand the main character better.  Sandy Stern, the protagonist, was a very interesting and believable character.

He peers into their minds, their foibles and weaknesses.		His narrative edges into the dark recesses of human sexuality, the arrogance and self-doubts of the lawyerly class and how it impinges on each of us. (Which of us hasn't lapsed into forbidden places and trembled before the might of The Law that kept us from it?)		Turow packages it within the limits of The Law, even as he recognizes what a corrupt cesspool it is. His characters are flawed, just like the person on the street, people lurking and peering at each other.		Yet there is a sameness to his characters: women lawyers flooded with venality, be they lesbian or libidinous heterosexuals. Furious women populate his narrative.		His panting male suitors obligingly deliver the goods, even as they wallow in their pitiful shame, chippying on their sad, outraged wives, who find them pathetic.		There are no men to be admired, especially the protagonists, no matter how lofty their claim to high-mindedeness. They squiggle around in the gutter. It's a lousy depiction of men."

"10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.87","Burden of Proof","B006Z2YK5S","I had previously read Scott Turow's PRESUMED INNOCENT and was a bit underwhelmed.  I titled my review of that book 'A Time Waster - Nothing More.\"  Then why read THE BURDEN OF PROOF?  I guess I just wanted a time waster.		I succeeded.  This book certainly is a waste of time.		Sandy Stern, defense attorney in PRESEMED INNOCENT, takes center stage here.  But Turow over-reaches.  Apparently forgetting that he is a writer of legal thrillers rather than Tolstoy or even Hemingway, Turow tries to do more than present the fun and lightweight murder story with a twist.  Instead, he tries to draw us in (and if we are suckers, we follow) to a world of intricate legal complexities surrounding the suicide of Stern's wife.  Ya know, maybe it's me, but some of those intricacies, such as the the defense of securities fraud claims, just did not grab me with the same force as, say, a man accused of murdering his lover only to find out that his wife did it instead.		Ok, maybe I should look at this book not as a legal thriller, but as a dramatic novel that happens to involve lawyers?  But again, it just does not live up to it.  The complexities, plot twists and interweaving storylines are more likely to make one either confused or, worse, bored, than they are to provide a coherent plotline that a reader cares about.  The characters come off as a bit hollow despite Turow's attempt to explore their inner lives, and the result is just a tired mess.		This is the problem for Turow.  Although an adequate mystery novelist, he seems, at least here, to want to be so much more.  I have not read any works of his published after THE BURDEN OF PROOF, and probably never will, but based on this clumsy attempt, like the guy at the end of the bar pontificating about what's really wrong with this country, he not only isn't up to the standard he thinks he is, he isn't even close."

It's a novel about the lead character,  Sandy Stern, who happens to be a lawyer, and who does get entangled in a  legal mess as the result of his wife's suicide, but the legal tangle and  it's solution is not really the point.  The major theme of the novel seems  to be that appearances are deceiving, that people within the same family  often work at cross purposes, and that even what seems to be direct  communication can be totally misinterpreted. Sandy Stern is deceptive and  deceiving, and so are all his family, friends and aquaintances. As he  uncovers secret after secret he realizes how his life and everyone in it is  largely a reflection of his own behavior.<p>Turow is a much better and  deeper writer than others in the &quot;legal thriller&quot; genre he's  lumped in with."
"10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.87","Burden of Proof","B006Z2YK5S","Scott Turow writes literature. Like John La Carre, the joy of reading his works lies in the journey through the book. Characters come alive; scenes are rich with description. Though not stream of consciousness novels, we are able to witness the thoughts of the actors, and discern their emotions as well as their understanding of life. In reading the \"Burden of Proof \" I often forgot that I was reading a mystery. To many readers that may be seen as a novelistic flaw, but to me it was a source of pleasure.		Sandy Stern has to cope with losing his wife who has committed suicide. How does a middle aged man make his way through this tragedy? How does a reserved, formal lawyer re-enter the world as a single man?  How does he manage to legally represent his adventuresome, risk taking brother-in-law? These are a few of the challenges he faces.		Yes it is a mystery; a double one in fact. One sub-plot involves the federal investigation of his brother-in-law for some questionable futures trading. Some readers may find this less interesting than the typical legal thriller where the protagonist is faced with defending a suspected murderer (as in Turow's \"Presumed Innocent\").  The other sub-plot concerns a medical mystery surrounding the death of Stern's wife.		This is not a book for lovers of heart pounding, action thrillers. It is a story where you savor the quality of the writing; where you enjoy the development of the characters, and where you take pleasure in the scenes and setting of the story.		One complaint I've come across in reviews of various books is the comment that the author could have told the same story in less than half the actual pages. Turow could have written this novel in half the actual 570 pages, but then we would have missed the beauty of the story as he wanted to tell it. One reviewer of this book indicated that Turow was trying to show his knowledge of the dictionary. That puzzles me; I didn't have to look up a single word, and I'm sure you won't have to either.		If you like both fine writing, and a good story Turow can't be beat."

The evidence and tension mounts as his former client, and former prosecutor battles to clear his friend's name in the pool of fascinating characters and locales of Kindle County.<p>This book is not \"Presumed Innocent\" for those who enjoyed that book. It is a great effort and very entertaining. A bit longer and more ponderous, it is still a tremendous story and flawlessly written. I say it is a must read.

"10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.87","Burden of Proof","B006Z2YK5S","This was my first Turow book to read.  It took me awhile to get used to his writing style, but once I did, I was hooked.  I was enthralled by the characters and the story line and couldn't wait to find out what happened  next.  Throughout the first 4/5 of the book, Turow adds many unexpected  plot twists that add to the mystery.  However, what could have been a great  book just turns into an average book because of the end.  I guess I  expected too much.  I wanted to see a totally unexpected surprise that went  against everything I thought would happen, but it just never came.  Instead, Turow lays out slowly piece by piece the solution to the puzzle.  Sure, the ending was not what I expected, but it wasn't a surprise.  Turow  never gives you time to be shocked or surprised at the ending.  <p>I liked  this book because Turow does shock and surprise throughout the first part  of the book.  His characters are well written.  I will probably read  another of his books, I just won't expect the big surprise ending."
"10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.87","Burden of Proof","B006Z2YK5S","In \"Burden of Proof\", lawyer and novelist Scott Turow returns the character of Alejandro \"Sandy\" Stern, the smooth-spoken, Argentine-Jewish defense attorney introduced in the earlier novel, \"Presumed Innocent\".  In that earlier novel, Stern defended a prosecutor in a high-profile murder case.  In \"Burden\", Stern now has all the questions.  Just when his existence seemed routine enough, Stern returns home from a business trip to find his wife dead - an apparent suicide.  Reeling from the loss, Stern must also confront a grand jury proceeding against his client and brother in law, Dixon Hartnell.  A web of complex (and suspicious) financial transactions involving futures-trading on Kindle County market run by Hartnell has whet the interest of the US Attorney's office, itself run by a foe of Stern.  Though Hartnell is the sort of guy who routinely seems to hover at the edge of indictment for something, the charges now offer the chance of landing the embattled broker in a federal lockup and, because Stern's son-in law works for Hartnell, threaten to tear at the fragile Stern family.  Into this mix of family and legal problems, Turow throws in Stern's romancing of his enemy at the US Attorney's office and of a nearby neighbor, his suspicions harbored against a neighbor who may have had an affair with Stern's now dead wife, and the story of his own romance, years ago, with Clara Mittler-Stern.  <p>\"Burden\" has Scott Turow's great prose and obsessive character dissection, but it's not as enveloping a book as \"Presumed Innocent\".  The sense of an underlying secret isn't as enticing as the murder investigation in the earlier book, and the characters don't grab you as well either.  Most annoying is Stern whose silver-tongued erudition was cute when he was a supporting character in the older book.  Dixon Hartnell would have been a more interesting choice of main character, but the plot makes that impossible.  Turow dangles the names of characters from the first book just to get our attentions (ex-PA Ray Horgan almost becomes the defense lawyer for Stern's embattled son in-law; Rusty Sabich is referred in passing as \"Judge Sabich\";  the specter of the corrupt Mayor Augie Bolcarro seems to hang like a smog over Kindle County) but remains it's own book.  Even the fictional choice of legal venue seems troublesome - exchanging the Kindle county court in \"Presumed\" with the anonymous Federal Court here.  Kindle County, which seemed so real and unique in the older book seems just another mid-west city.  The nivel concentrates instead on the byzantine relationships of its main characters, but after you've finished, you wonder why you should care.  This is a pretty good novel, but it loses something and suffers in comparison to its prequel."
"10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.87","Burden of Proof","B006Z2YK5S","I put off reading this book for some time because it looked like too much work.  I've enjoyed many Grisham novels and wanted to try out some other legal thrillers and see what they were like.  Turow is a good writer, without question, but he lacks, at least in this book, some of the flash or pizzaz I was hoping for after reading others.  This novel is definitely not a page turning thriller, but it is a solid story.<p>Some of the legal complications get hard to follow unless you have at least a minimal grasp of how financial markets work, but basic evil is usually pretty easy to spot so don't let the setting throw you off.  Turow obviously works at his craft with some measure of pride, so I don't count the few words and/or concepts that are over my head get the better of me, the context makes the actions plain enough.<p>So the real question is do I give this book a recommendation?  Well, yes. It's an entertaining mystery/legal setting type book and while it doesn't read with the same speed and ease of some others, it's still worth checking out."
"10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.87","Burden of Proof","B006Z2YK5S","If you enjoy reading a \"novel\", read Turow; if you prefer comic books, read Grisham or Patterson, or the rest of said ilk.  This is a complex story of a middle-aged man, who loses his much-loved wife to a mysterious suicide.  Turow develops the personalities of his characters, and weaves a multi-faceted plot line, just as occurs in real-life circumstances.  \"Burden of Proof\" is one of the best novels I have ever read, and quite different from \"Presumed Innocent\", which most folks know from the Harrison Ford movie."
"10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.87","Burden of Proof","B006Z2YK5S","Since I am relatively new to Scott Turow, I continue to be amazed by his writing.  The story has been well described by others.  While it is a very interesting story, what make this book (and his other books as well) exceptional is the depth of emotions and the insights of individual characters about themselves and others.  This puts Turow well above other authors on this genre.  The Burden of Proof explores the vast range of feeling connected with Sandy Stern's dealing with the suicide of his wife, his family members and friends as well as the very complex and fascinating legal situation of his brother-in-law and how the rest of his family was involved.  I found the book to hold my interest from beginning to end.  Who knew when reading \"Presumed Innocent\" that Sandy Stern would be such an interesting character!"
"10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.87","Burden of Proof","B006Z2YK5S","This is the second Turow novel I've read and I'm hooked.

This book is solid evidence of his skills and I recommend it heartily.<p>I know how popular Grisham is and I've enjoyed some of his writing, but I'd rate Turow as easily the better writer.  This book has plenty to help me reach that conclusion:  family and business deceit, awkward romantic liasons, legal and personal grudges and jealousies, securities fraud, etc.  Try it, I'll bet you'll like it."
"10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.84","Medical History","0974946656","Brief this is not, but compared to some dry academic tomes it seems brief.  University of Southern California professor Dr. Michael T. Kennedy has the all too rare gift of writing well which he combines with a passion for detail so that this history is packed with the bizarre, the fascinating, the arcane, and the all too often revolting facts of medical delusion, malpractice, and triumph that have characterized the long and tortured history of the healing arts.<p>Note well that this is a history not only of medicine and disease, but of science as well.  The emphasis is on twentieth century developments, which is as it should be since so much has happened in recent times.  This is not to say that the more distant past is neglected.  Kennedy starts with the pre-history and follows the quest for health through Greek and Roman times to &quot;The Rise of Islam and Arabic Medicine&quot; (Chapter 5) with excursions into ayurvedic medicine (from India) and the traditional Chinese practices from antiquity.  He even looks at European health, or the lack thereof, during the Dark and Middle Ages before the rise of science.  When he gets to the modern or nearly modern era, Kennedy organizes less by chronology and more by subject matter.  Some of the later chapters are about &quot;Cardiac Surgery,&quot; &quot;Transplantation,&quot; &quot;Psychiatry,&quot; etc.  I particularly liked the crisp way he dealt with psychoanalytic theory and the inefficacy of psychoanalysis.  <p>Frankly, I don't know if there is anything else quite like this available.  The recognized authority on the subject of the history of medicine in English, University College London's late Roy Porter wrote both a popular account, Blood and Guts: A Short History of Medicine (2002), and a full blown treatment, The Greatest Benefit to Mankind (1997) which Kennedy cites.  I have read the former and it is to Kennedy's book as Mary Poppins is to Hamlet.  There are other histories, but most are either not current or too voluminous or too restricted in content.  <p>Dr. Kennedy shows how various ideas and methods were developed, how they stemmed from, or were in contrast to, earlier methods; and he highlights the personalities of the practitioners as he describes what they did or discovered.  He also focuses on patients and their stories.  His style is sharp and uncluttered.  Sometimes he employs a dry, cynical wit.  At other times his report takes on extra-medical aspects that lend depth and familiarity to his portraits, as when, for example, he reports on the tragic death of transplant pioneer, Dr. David Hume. (p. 388)<p>Here are some examples of the kind of detail that I found fascinating:<p>&quot;The early Middle Ages saw little consumption of animal protein by the peasants, but legume production, which increased with the agricultural revolution, reduced the dependence on carbohydrates and led to rapid population growth again.&quot; (p. 69)<p>And on the following page: &quot;Women lived shorter lives than men in the Middle Ages...This is attributed to the hazards of childbirth, but also to an iron deficient diet...[because] animal protein was not available.&quot;<p>&quot;...[A]lthough opium offered some relief of pain...until the anesthesia era, speed was the sign of the good surgeon.&quot; (p. 85)<p>&quot;Infectious diseases were uncommon in primitive societies because the available pool of susceptible individuals was too small and the contact with other groups was not common.&quot; (p. 87)  Indeed, infectious disease is part of the price we pay for agriculture and civilization.<p>Quoting Freud: &quot;I often console myself with the idea that, even though we achieve so little therapeutically, at least we understand why more cannot be achieved.&quot; (p. 401)  This is doubly ironic since Freud was even deceived in what he thought he understood.  A few pages later Kennedy drily remarks that psychotherapy &quot;is useful in helping adults to deal with life stress.  It has little or no role in treating psychosis.  The serious mental illnesses are increasingly seen as biological disorders.&quot; (p. 424)<p>The only weakness of this book is that it could have used a more meticulous editor.  (The proofreading is excellent.)  Kennedy's writing style is fast-forward, actually suggesting to me how medical history might be written had somebody like, say, novelist James M. Cain taken his hand to it.  The words just rush down the page.  Kennedy has so much to say and he wants to get it all said.  Sometimes one has to read a sentence twice since sometimes his tenses are a little eccentric, and parallel construction is not always strictly observed.<p>There are two indices, one for names, but I notice that the aforementioned Roy Porter, for example, does not appear in either of them.  Probably the names in the footnotes were left out.  Also the references (545 of them) are collected at the end of each chapter, which is fine, but there is no overall alphabetized bibliography.  This is a pet peeve of mine since one has to chase through chapter after chapter to see if a particular work is cited.<p>However Kennedy more than makes up for this deficiency with what he calls a &quot;Postscript&quot; which is a lightly annotated bibliography organized into the categories, &quot;Recommended Reading,&quot; &quot;General Sources,&quot; and sources by individual chapters.<p>Bottom line: the best history of medicine that I have found and a delight to read."
"10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.84","Medical History","0974946656","Personally I always enjoy a historical book that actually discusses history and not some surgically altered history that only reports the things that went right.  That is what you get with &quot;A Brief History of Disease, Science &amp; Medicine&quot;.  Not only do you read about the great advances in medicine but also about the mistakes that were made along the way.  Although the book was written with the first year medical student in mind it is easy enough to read and understand by those with only a passing knowledge of basic first aid.  Perhaps one sentence from the Forward best describes the writing style - &quot;...it has been written to be read, rather than studied.&quot;  <p>Dr. Kennedy states that this book was not widely accepted by the academic presses and so was published independently.  It is fairly obvious that one of the reasons this might be the case is his candid examination of the history of medicine.  In an age when most practitioners of the medical profession seem to feel that they have perfect knowledge, Dr. Kennedy's book shows that they have often been wrong with tragic results.  Take for instance the case of Ignaz Semmelweiss who worked in a hospital where there was a twenty-nine percent mortality rate for women giving birth.  Through experimentation and deduction he came to believe that washing your hands between patients and after autopsies would cause this rate to drop.  He ordered that hand washing would be done between patients and the rate of death dropped drastically.  However, since he had not reason why it worked it was resisted, he eventually resigned (other historians have noted that he was forced to resign) and the doctors returned to their old habits and the old mortality rate.  After all it made no sense to them that something they could not see could make any difference.  Many people will immediately see the similarities between things like this and modern attitude of medical science as related to alternative therapies - if we don't yet understand how it works then it must not work.  Most medical history texts are severely sanitized to keep such historical errors out.  So, it is really no surprise that this book, which portrays history as it was, from many primary sources, is not the most popular one among the medical establishment.<p>Personally, I enjoyed the book but I am one of those who enjoys history from a viewpoint of accuracy - warts and all.  Still you should be prepared to have some of your history that you learned in high school discredited.  I remember learning that Louis Pasteur invented innoculations to prevent disease in the later 1800's, but the fact is that Charles Maitland and others were doing it in the 1700's.  &quot;A Brief History of Disease, Science and Medicine&quot; is a recommended read for anyone interested in the history and progression of medicine."
"10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.84","Medical History","0974946656","This is both an extremely ambitious and enormously entertaining history of the development of the medical treatment of human beings throughout the ages. It is ambitious in that the author attempts to survey the field from prehistory until the present day, and to do so in less than five hundred pages. The scope means that at times things of necessity have to be left out. For instance, the great story in science as a whole (and in medicine in particular) between classical antiquity and the early 17th century is the growth and eventual downfall of Aristotelianism, which provided the scientific background for nearly every branch of scientific endeavor during that time. Many of the key events of that story are briefly recounted, but many are not (e.g., allied discoveries by Galileo in astronomy that refuted Aristotelian assumptions). Still, given the limitations of space, this is an admirable treatment of the subject. To deal with every issue comprehensibly would have expanded dramatically the size of the book, which would have given the lie to the title. My one serious objection to the book is that the book does not have an overarching narrative structure. I'm not always sure what particular story is being told. Nonetheless, it is impossible to come away from the book without a far deeper appreciation for the remarkable journey medicine has undertaken over the centuries. It also makes me enormously grateful that I am alive today, and not in some previous century.<p>Above all, this is a fun, engaging, thoroughly entertaining book. Although the book sometimes veers towards the encyclopedic, the style at all times is anecdotal. The author loves his subject, and especially delights in the quirkier side of things. There are mountains of fascinating trivia, and as a lover of great trivia I was constantly saying to myself, &quot;Wow, I didn't know that!&quot; Some of the more fascinating bits of the book are when Kennedy discusses famous individuals and the way in which disease may have affected them, such as Ivan the Terrible or Henry VIII. Even in modern medical discoveries, he has an eye for the unusual.<p>This is also, however, a very educational book. The amount of information contained in its pages is fairly staggering. One great use for the book is to read through the sections on a particular epoch if one is engaged in historical reading. But the book is more than a collection of interesting facts. The reader gains an appreciation for the way that medical practice has developed over the centuries. For instance, Kennedy discusses how before the invention of anesthesia speed was a highly esteemed virtue in a surgeon. Surgery was performed quickly, and as a result there was less of an emphasis on working carefully and carefully suturing. But with the development of anesthesia, surgery slowed down, and surgeons took more care to operate with great care and to minimize injury to tissue. This is merely one random example out of thousands.<p>One of the most appealing aspects of the book is the deeply personal style of the author. Closely aligned with his love of the anecdotes and trivia is his eye for the humorous side of things. He also writes with a personal touch. In discussing some medical condition, he will mention that he had had such a case himself at such and such a point, or that someone had devised a form of pediatric surgery, and he later had as a patient the second recipient ever of that treatment. Or he will mention that his mother's uncle had a certain medical condition, or aunt was a nurse for a famous doctor.<p>This truly is a book suited for a variety of audiences. I have a strong interest in history, and as a result I enjoyed most the first half, in part because I had the background to understand everything there pretty easily. I struggled a bit more in the second half as medicine became more specialized, but I imagine that this half would be of greater interest to medical students or physicians. The main thing that I want to emphasize is that both the medical student and the educated nonspecialist will equally find much to enjoy in the book. Similarly, one could also employ the book merely as a reference work, or read it several chapters at a time. It is rare, however, that a book can be so educational over such a wide-ranging subject, and entertain so thoroughly at the same time."
"10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.84","Medical History","0974946656","I couldn't put it down, because it hit so many of my buttons: history, medical sciences, and just plain storytelling. While I'm most known in network engineering, clinical medicine has always been an intellectual love. While I often tell people &quot;I'm not a doctor but I simulate them on computers,&quot; I learned a great deal from this book -- above all, the connections and less-than-obvious relationships between concepts.  Kennedy chronicles both the major insights and the terribly wrong blind alleys that characterize what many call the &quot;youngest science&quot;.	  It's too easy to forget, looking at modern medicine, how recent most developments are -- and yet how many ancient insights were correct. Kennedy literally goes back to the dawn of history, explaining original ideas, how they were expanded upon, how they were confused, and how they finally converged into a scientific discipline -- that remains an art.	  While the author occasionally does drop to the molecular level, it isn't necessary to have a detailed background to understand the map he reveals. There are enough very specific insights to give a medical expert a few pleasant doubletakes, as well as to introduce the layman to how we reached our current views.	  There were times that I wanted more detail on a technical topic, but isn't it traditional for the great storytellers to leave you hanging, wanting more?	  The author doesn't ignore that medicine always exists in a social and technical context.  Religion has both suppressed and enhanced medical knowledge, and he presents both ends of the spectrum.  Anyone who gets into the real world of hospitals, to say nothing of academic research, learns very quickly of the profusion of enormous egos -- and the politics resulting from them. While people may be pictured smiling as they receive Nobel Prizes, quite a number were suppressing rage at their co-awardees, or feeling terrible because their collaborator wasn't up there as well.	  In modern times, more general financial and political interests have a great deal to do with the practice of medicine. Kennedy has definite opinions on where managed care and outcomes research improved care, and also where they've gone horribly wrong."
"10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.84","Medical History","0974946656","A Brief History Of Disease, Science &amp; Medicine is the product of Dr. Michael Kennedy's three year research project to write a book that would fill the unfortunate gaps in most medical student's educational curriculums, and also be of considerable value for the non-specialist general reader seeking a clearer understanding of the long history behind what we commonly recognize as the history of medical development from superstition to science. The first eight chapters aptly cover the history of early medicine and science described in more detail than typical medical history. Then Dr. Kennedy goes on to cover the discovery of anesthesia and antisepsis, the development of modern medicine and surgery, and concludes with a history of medical economics (including the origin of medical malpractice litigation).

"10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.84","Medical History","0974946656","At some point in the nineteenth century, the practice of medicine was transformed into medical science. Before that time, while there were some people who critically examined techniques of treatment, most medical practitioners did more harm than good.  At best, the treatment did no harm and there was tremendous resistance by the medical profession to change, even when the benefit was clearly demonstrated. Many women died in childbirth due to infections caused by doctors going directly from dissecting cadavers to delivering babies without washing their hands. It was not until sometime in the twentieth century before it could be said that the medical profession had alleviated more suffering than it caused.	 This book chronicles all of this and is one of best written histories that I have encountered, independent of subject. It all starts in the first few pages, where you learn that early humans who were hunter-gatherers did not suffer from many acute diseases. After populations spent generations in the same general area, most diseases had adapted to being chronic in nature. Few people died from those diseases and new ones were rarely introduced into the population.	 Three things, leading to the rise of civilization, changed that. The first was the domestication of animals, which allowed for the trans-species migration of diseases. This was a bit of a surprise to me, although it should not have been. The modern and deadly diseases of AIDS and Ebola are both caused by viruses that have migrated from other primates. As I write this, countries in Asia are killing enormous numbers of chickens in an attempt to prevent a disease virus from moving from chickens to humans.	  The second event was the development of agriculture, which required stationary populations, and allowed the numbers to grow dramatically. This led to the profession of civil engineering and how to provide potable water and dispose of waste. Until recently, this has been a chronic problem and many epidemics have been due to contaminated water.	 The third event is the increased mobility of populations, which is a more recent event. Strains of diseases that are chronic and mild in one population due to generations of acquired immunity become plagues when introduced to new populations. So much of the history of the world has been shaped by disease, which is one of the primary themes explained in detail. The Europeans gave the Americas smallpox and the Americans gave the Europeans syphilis.  Asia gave Europe the bubonic plague, and Africa gave the world AIDS. I was very impressed with how Kennedy describes these events and explains how they changed the world.	 Some of the most fascinating historical accounts dealt with individuals. The Russian Czar known as Ivan the Terrible was not always so terrible. In the early years of his reign, he was very enlightened, establishing schools and a legal code. However, in his later years, he earned his historical moniker, even killing his own son. His body was exhumed in the years of Soviet rule and it showed clear evidence of tertiary syphilis. Therefore, the insanity of his last years and the devastating consequences for Russian history were most likely due to his suffering from advanced syphilis. Although not proven, there are strong indications that Henry VIII of England also suffered from tertiary syphilis, which can explain some of the erratic behavior in his later years. One cannot help but be astonished at the rates of syphilitic infection in Europe a short time after it was brought back by the early explorers of the Americas. In 1599, one-third of the inhabitants of Paris were infected with syphilis. Given that it is transmitted primarily by sexual contact, this figure is incredible. It also indicates how sexually promiscuous the Parisians had to be and points out that there were times in history where people were more sexually promiscuous than they are now.	  One cannot help but be astonished by the resistance to change that has pervaded the medical profession throughout its existence. It would be hard to find any other group of people who have exhibited such a conservative mindset for so long. In some ways, the only place where similar mindsets can be found is in religion. On the personal side, Kennedy occasionally refers to events in his life. There are not many, but they are expressed in a very matter of fact manner. It is unusual to read something like, \"I was there when we tried . . .  ., the patient died.\"	 This book is a real riveting page-turner. Once I started reading it, it was the only book that I read until I finished it and now I have to catch up on all my other projects."
"10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.84","Medical History","0974946656","In this litigious time when physicians and all medical care workers tend to live under an umbrella of suspect brought on by the intervention of the media, vast lawsuits, big business (pharmaceutical companies) intervention, and computer access to data, there has occurred a response in the medical facilities to promote 'defensive medicine' to instruct the nascent students how to cope with the antagonistic world outside the halls of the teaching hospitals. This has resulted in less emphasis on the learning of the skills of the time honored Doctor-Patient relationship and in creating the aura that physicians dwell in glass dome sanctuaries of science: the quiet moments of sharing personal fears and concerns and relieving the pain in the souls of the patient and patients' families seem relics of the past house-call/caring-physician image. Michael Kennedy in his book A BRIEF HISTORY OF DISEASE, SCIENCE & MEDICINE has done more to rectify this widening gap between physician and patient than any volume I have read. This meticulously written, dignified yet very warm and honest look at medicine from the Ice Age to the era of molecular and genetic concepts for the present and the future reads more like a fascinating novel than an academic treatise. There are facts and histories discussed here which will enlighten not only the general public but also the men and women of medicine - from premed student to retired doctor. It is simply an amazing source of knowledge while simultaneously being an honest, no-holds-barred review of how we came to this point in healthcare. And if ever there were a time when this book was needed, it is certainly now. Read this fascinating tome and learn not only the extraordinary progress made in the mystery of disease and physical meanderings away from the 'normal', but at the same time see just how vulnerable is the scientist and physician in dealing with new aspects of the art of practicing medicine through time. Kennedy and his colleagues have added an important adjunct to the re-entry of humanism in the teaching of medicine at his alma mater: this book demonstrates that journey of commitment to resurrect the precious healing relationship between the doctor and those who approach him for succor. Read this book for a highly dignified history of medicine, for some amazing insights into disease process, and for reassurance the perhaps the return of the sanctity of healthcare delivery is a possibility. A fine and very important achievement, Dr. Kennedy!"

He also focuses on patients and their stories.  His style is sharp and uncluttered.  Sometimes he employs a dry, cynical wit.  At other times his report takes on extra-medical aspects that lend depth and familiarity to his portraits, as when, for example, he reports on the tragic death of transplant pioneer, Dr. David Hume. (p. 388)		Here are some examples of the kind of detail that I found fascinating:		\"The early Middle Ages saw little consumption of animal protein by the peasants, but legume production, which increased with the agricultural revolution, reduced the dependence on carbohydrates and led to rapid population growth again.\" (p. 69)		And on the following page: \"Women lived shorter lives than men in the Middle Ages...This is attributed to the hazards of childbirth, but also to an iron deficient diet...[because] animal protein was not available.\"		\"...[A]lthough opium offered some relief of pain...until the anesthesia era, speed was the sign of the good surgeon.\" (p. 85)		\"Infectious diseases were uncommon in primitive societies because the available pool of susceptible individuals was too small and the contact with other groups was not common.\" (p. 87)  Indeed, infectious disease is part of the price we pay for agriculture and civilization.		Quoting Freud: \"I often console myself with the idea that, even though we achieve so little therapeutically, at least we understand why more cannot be achieved.\" (p. 401)  This is doubly ironic since Freud was even deceived in what he thought he understood.  A few pages later Kennedy drily remarks that psychotherapy \"is useful in helping adults to deal with life stress.  It has little or no role in treating psychosis.  The serious mental illnesses are increasingly seen as biological disorders.\" (p. 424)		The only weakness of this book is that it could have used a more meticulous editor.  (The proofreading is excellent.)  Kennedy's writing style is fast-forward, actually suggesting to me how medical history might be written had somebody like, say, novelist James M. Cain taken his hand to it.  The words just rush down the page.  Kennedy has so much to say and he wants to get it all said.  Sometimes one has to read a sentence twice since sometimes his tenses are a little eccentric, and parallel construction is not always strictly observed.		There are two indices, one for names, but I notice that the aforementioned Roy Porter, for example, does not appear in either of them.  Probably the names in the footnotes were left out.  Also the references (545 of them) are collected at the end of each chapter, which is fine, but there is no overall alphabetized bibliography.  This is a pet peeve of mine since one has to chase through chapter after chapter to see if a particular work is cited.		However Kennedy more than makes up for this deficiency with what he calls a \"Postscript\" which is a lightly annotated bibliography organized into the categories, \"Recommended Reading,\" \"General Sources,\" and sources by individual chapters.		Bottom line: the best history of medicine that I have found and a delight to read."
"10.1525/jps.2010.XXXIX.3.84","Medical History","0974946656","In this litigious time when physicians and all medical care workers tend to live under an umbrella of suspect brought on by the intervention of the media, vast lawsuits, big business (pharmaceutical companies) intervention, and computer access to data, there has occurred a response in the medical facilities to promote 'defensive medicine' to instruct the nascent students how to cope with the antagonistic world outside the halls of the teaching hospitals. This has resulted in less emphasis on the learning of the skills of the time honored Doctor-Patient relationship and in creating the aura that physicians dwell in glass dome sanctuaries of science: the quiet moments of sharing personal fears and concerns and relieving the pain in the souls of the patient and patients' families seem relics of the past house-call/caring-physician image.		Michael Kennedy in his book A BRIEF HISTORY OF DISEASE, SCIENCE & MEDICINE has done more to rectify this widening gap between physician and patient than any volume I have read. This meticulously written, dignified yet very warm and honest look at medicine from the Ice Age to the era of molecular and genetic concepts for the present and the future reads more like a fascinating novel than an academic treatise. There are facts and histories discussed here which will enlighten not only the general public but also the men and women of medicine - from premed student to retired doctor. It is simply an amazing source of knowledge while simultaneously being an honest, no-holds-barred review of how we came to this point in healthcare. And if ever there were a time when this book was needed, it is certainly now. Read this fascinating tome and learn not only the extraordinary progress made in the mystery of disease and physical meanderings away from the 'normal', but at the same time see just how vulnerable is the scientist and physician in dealing with new aspects of the art of practicing medicine through time.		Kennedy and his colleagues have added an important adjunct to the re-entry of humanism in the teaching of medicine at his alma mater: this book demonstrates that journey of commitment to resurrect the precious healing relationship between the doctor and those who approach him for succor. Read this book for a highly dignified history of medicine, for some amazing insights into disease process, and for reassurance the perhaps the return of the sanctity of healthcare delivery is a possibility. A fine and very important achievement, Dr. Kennedy!  Grady Harp, January 09"

The task of introducing the biblical, historical, and practical aspects of missions is a massive enterprise. The best audience for this book is someone who is a believer who hasn't yet carefully studied cross cultural ministry or the idea of \"missions\" and would like an overview.		Let's get started with the authors' definition of missions, \"Missions is a specialized Term. By it I mean the sending forth of authorized persons beyond the borders of the New Testament church and her immediate gospel influence to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ in gospel-destitute areas, to win converts from other faiths or non-faiths to Jesus Christ, and to establish functioning, multiplying local congregations who will bear the fruit of Christianity in that community and to that country.\"		The first section of the book, Encountering Mission in the Scriptures, is a tour of the scriptural content that demonstrates the unstoppable march of God's love for all peoples from creation until the end of the New Testament. God's message of hope and provision of salvation in Christ for all peoples is the summary of the Old and New Testaments.		In the second section, Encountering Missions in History, the authors describe the spread of the gospel throughout history and across the world until today. From the almost imperceptible beginnings of the Christian movement in Jerusalem the authors trace its expansion to become a global faith.		In the third section, Encountering Missions as a Candidate, the authors give practical suggestions to help interested believers discern how to decide to become a missionary, prepare to go, and choose an organization to be sent through. The authors consider short and long-term missions opportunities as well evaluate full and part-time ministry options.		The final section, Encountering Missions as a Sent One or a Sender, the authors give advice on how to become effective in a new culture and begin to have impact. This section was surprisingly brief, little was written to introduce the various approaches and strategies for reaching a people group for Christ.		This introduction to missions is true to its title, it covers the biblical, historical, and practical aspects of God's dealing with man across time and God use of men to spread his message of love and truth."

Of course, this is not actually included. I'm getting on to the publishers to see if I can get the content from them but it's not included here.

It seeks to explain why the state was rolled back further in the US and the UK than on the European continent in the 1980s: the author argues this happened because the state played a significantly more influential role in the US and the UK economies in the 60s & 70s than the state did in France and Germany, prompting a more severe backlash against statism in the US and the UK.

In normal fashion, Lonely Planet does a great job with historic and cultural information pertaining to a certain locality, but once again falls short on the in-depth info that many travelers would be interested in.  For instance, national parks and world heritage sites are usually not covered in enough detail, and sometimes they're not mentioned at all.  Much of the information is very basic as well, and doesn't really paint a solid picture of the park.  Sure, we all know there are animals running around, but what makes it stand out?  Notable exceptions would be Etosha and Kruger, both of which have good coverage, but so many other options exist and are just barely mentioned.  Major cities are covered well, but so many exciting points of interest are over-looked that sometimes I wonder if the publishers think that most travellers are going to spend their entire trip in wine bars and discos.  If you're interested in truly seeing this region and some of the fabulous, remote places that it has to offer, Lonely Planet will get you close, but other guides will actually get you there."

Big mistake.  For South Africa, it misses several of the major attractions altogether, including Seal Island and Gold Reef City.  When the book does mention attractions, it rarely gives any information on how to see them.  In an illustrative moment, it mentions the Sterkfontein Caves in the introductory section on Africa's ancient past--but no where in the book  does it mention that they offer a museum and guided tours in South Africa an easy distance for Joberg.  (The Sterkfontein Caves are a UNESCO World Heritage Site, not a minor attraction by any measure).		So that's what you can expect for the most well-traveled of the countries in this book.

"10.2307/40984560","Class Acts: Service and Inequality in Luxury Hotels","0520247825","I just finished reading Class Acts:  Service and Inequality in Luxury Hotels, and I mean reading it:  Acknowlegments, Introduction, Chapters 1-6, Conclusion, Appendices A, B & C, and Notes.  Okay, I did not read References and Index, but close enough.		  What a great ethnography!  What a great voice!  The writer, Rachel Sherman, manages to be impressively objective and fair as she observes and participates in the service economy of the luxury hotel.  Since I am an arm chair-bleeding heart liberal, I wanted there to be a clear demarcation between \"good guys\" and \"bad guys,\" but Sherman paints a far more complicated and nuanced picture of the social dynamics at work in the luxury service sector.  As a result, the Conclusion provides a satisfying critique, since it is in this section that Sherman lets her views be known.  I find this admirable because it indicates this researcher's ability to distinguish between observation, analysis, and critique.		  Class Acts is a scholarly work, yet the writing style is extremely lucid.  Yes, the author uses jargon -- intersubjectivity, habitus, interpellated -- but what is really cool is how Sherman uses language to mirror some of the class distinctions she is writing about, at times conveying theory and abstraction and at others conveying terms like \"ripped off\" and \"pissed.\"  The contrast is refreshing.		  Sherman also does an excellent job of sign postng.  In a straightforward way, she reminds the reader of who is who, foreshadows ideas to come, and acknowledges ideas previously introduced.  I found all these textual reminders to be helpful.  Not only that, but Sherman offers advice on how to tip in the Notes.		  Finally, the author does a great job weaving the motif of  movies and image making throughout the text -- from Pretty Woman to My Dinner with Andre -- to underscore both the transformative power of the luxury hotel setting and the nature of work and class distinctions."
"10.2307/40984560","Class Acts: Service and Inequality in Luxury Hotels","0520247825","\"Class Acts: Service and Inequality in Luxury Hotels\" is a captivating look at how class gets played out in a particular setting -- and yet it has a lot to say about how we all relate to our social and economic class (whether or not we work or stay at luxury hotels). It's a sociological study, and though I'm not a sociologist, I found it accessible, not too academic, and packed with interesting anecdotes.		The author, Rachel Sherman, talks about the luxury hotel as a kind of \"theater\" where guests and workers act out class relations and fill their own needs. For their part, workers strive to protect their dignity, even as they are subservient on the job to very wealthy guests. To accomplish this, workers may take pride in their skills, criticize guests behind their backs, or--as discussed in an especially fascinating section of the book--turn their jobs into a kind of strategic game. Meanwhile, guests rationalize the lavish service they enjoy by, for example, treating workers as equals or even friends--in the process \"erasing\" class differences or acting as if they don't exist. The book could have stopped there and been really interesting; but it goes further, and shows how workers and guests come to depend on each other to perform (or even become) their roles.		I once stayed in a luxury hotel for a few nights on work. The book grabbed me because of the backstage look it provides at this dramatic setting, and held onto me for another reason. We all play strategic \"games\" on the job and elsewhere, we all play roles in relation to people of various classes, we all rationalize our choices and tell ourselves stories to make sense of things. That's why \"Class Acts\" is pertinent to everyday life and politics in America."
"10.2307/40984560","Class Acts: Service and Inequality in Luxury Hotels","0520247825","\"Just the facts, Ma'am\" encapsulates this book for me.  Reading it took me back to my school days and gave me that \"book report is due\" feeling. The author's approach is very scientific, detailed, emotionless as though the writer may have a touch of Asperger's Syndrome.  It appears to be only half a book because so much of the emotional aspects of her experiences are missing. I can hardly imagine a more emotionally charged atmosphere than a 5-star hotel crammed with wealthy, pampered, driven, ambitious people juxtaposed intimately with those whose very livelihoods depend on satisfying their every inane desire. Yet the author makes it sound as exciting as filling orders at Starbucks.  The myriad people this author encountered had fascinating stories to tell that could have shed light on what life is like in the hospitality industry.  Yet we hear nothing.  Susie did this.  Bob did that.  I worked here.  I worked there.  Boring.  Boring.  Boring.  What was the purpose of this book, anyway?  There are a few humorous stories here and there.  The guests seem oblivious, the staff comes across as basically money-hungry, ever looking for that next tip - only doing nice things for the guests to get more money.  If this is what staying at a swanky hotel is like - I'll take the Holiday Inn.  At least I know where I stand.  And I don't have to stock up on one dollar bills before checking in."
"10.2307/40986343","Queer Gothic","0252073533","One would be hard pressed to accomplish significant scholarship in the area of Gothic literature without developing at least a passing acquaintance with queer criticism.  The sub-genre of the Gothic, embodied by novels containing countless instances of incestuous and homosocial relationships, not only invites, but demands the attention of a queer eye.  However, following the winding, subterraneous paths of a queer reading can be a daunting task, especially for the budding scholar of the Gothic.  One needs to be able to take into account the complex theories of foundational critics such as Freud, Foucault, Sedgwick, and Butler in order to recognize the impact queer themes and relationships might have on the reading of gothic fiction.  Unpacking the latent intricacies in the Gothic involves discerning what these queer themes are saying about the texts' crucial scenes.  Without a consideration of a queer reading, the Gothic loses one of its fundamental sources of influence and significance.  Consequently, the reader's experience with the Gothic would prove disingenuous and wanting.		  Thankfully, the canon of gothic criticism has George Haggerty, Professor of English at The University of California, Riverside, to shine an insightful light on its queer avenues.  Haggerty's 2006 book, Queer Gothic, offers a comprehensive, yet in-depth examination of queer elements throughout the Gothic.  Haggerty introduces this text as \"the culmination of a career in gothic fiction\" (ix). It should be noted that Haggerty's is an impressive, prolific career that includes earlier books Gothic Fiction/Gothic Form (1989), Unnatural Affections: Women and Fiction in the Later 18th Century (1998), and Men in Love (1999), as well as numerous scholarly journal publications.		  Haggerty begins his study with the first appearance of gothic text, Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, and traces the development of the Gothic across time and genre, concluding the work with an examination of Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles.  At each stop on his book's nine-chapter tour, Haggerty walks the reader through a close reading of queer elements at work in an average of three to four different gothic texts.  The author has divided the nine chapters into three three-chapter parts: \"Gothic Sexuality,\" \"Gothic Culture,\" and \"Gothic Fictions and the Queering of Culture.\"  Exploring eighteenth-century gothic fiction, moving to gothic drama, and eventually jumping the pond to consider twentieth-century American gothic offspring, Haggerty demonstrates the cultural impacts the Gothic's queer elements have had across history.		  In his introduction, Haggerty offers an overview and explanation of the three sections of his study and places himself within the current body of gothic criticism: \"I imagine this book as a gathering of analyses that together make an important point about the ways in which gothic fiction anticipates the history of sexuality and gives that history its most basic materials\" (5).  With this purpose in mind, Haggerty quickly asserts the existence and value of a gothic-queer connection.  In his first chapter, Haggerty explains that a queer reading \"can begin to show the ways in which gothic works beyond the limits of its structural `meaning' to change the structure of meaning itself.  Gothic fiction is about reaching into some undefinable world beyond fictional reality. . . That is why gothic fiction remains as queer as it is, and it also suggests why and how gothic remains to challenge the status quo and at the same time to expand its purview\" (10).  With this understanding in mind, Haggerty begins an exploration of the ways various texts in the gothic canon subvert the heteronormative assumptions of their day.		  The author devotes significant attention to describing how classic gothic texts lend themselves to a queer reading.  Drawing on the gender bending and incestuous violence in Matthew Lewis's The Monk, the eyebrow-raising mother-daughter relations in Ann Radcliffe's novels, and the reverse Oedipal pattern in Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, Haggerty makes a strong case for queer themes at work in the Gothic since its inception.  And he accomplishes all of this with a tone that is two parts scholarly, one part cheeky.  Who would not enjoy reading a text containing such chapter subtitles as \"Poor Conrad\" (Walpole lovers delight!) and \"Mothers and Other Lovers\" (21, 30)?		 If any caution is to be offered when approaching Queer Gothic, it is to set aside time for background reading.  In an effort to ground his study, Haggerty refers frequently to several key theorists and present-day scholars.  Judith Butler and Michel Foucault both exercise influence over the study, as do studies by David Halperin, David Punter, Cynthia Griffin Wolff, and Nina Auerbach.  This support system of authorities acts as a double-edged sword, providing a deeper, more credible basis for Haggerty's arguments, while simultaneously making portions of the text especially challenging for any newbies to the gothic arena.  On a related note, those less familiar (or concerned) with the modern incarnations of the Gothic may find the latter chapters difficult.  Thankfully, each part, if not each chapter, successfully stands on its own as an individual study, permitting some jumping around on the part of the reader.		 On the whole, Haggerty's study proves to be a challenging and rewarding read that offers its audience an enlightening and, at times, humorous journey through the queer world of gothic texts."

"10.2307/41472361","Cosmopolitanism","039332933X","I have completely bought into Professor Kwame Anthony Appiah's  Cosmopolitanism, etymologically from \"cosmos\" = universe + \"pilites\" = citizen of \"polis\" = city + -ism = strong ideological/philosophical stance. I didn't know that , too. The guy, the author of this book, is insanely brilliant; I never thought I could read a book on philosophy, having taken only two philosophy courses in college, although  I read a lot on the Philosophy of Science and the Methodology of Economics. Superb work!		The book tells us that globalization is out; localization is in.  But cosmopolitan localization comes with a clear head and mainly a warm heart. Cosmopolitans' sensibilities no longer depend on the travels to remote places by curious anthropologists and their interpretations of the world, far from it. The foreigners are already here - among us - and to stay. This means \"cosmopolitan isn't hard work; repudiating it is (p.  xx); it begins with the simple idea that in the human community, as in national communities, we need to develop habits of coexistence: conversation in its older meaning, of living together, association\" (p. xix).  The fact that \"the foreignness of foreigners, the strangeness of strangers  ... are real enough, [but also that]  we have been encouraged ... to exaggerate their significance by an order of magnitude\" (p. xxi) challenges our inherited values and value systems.  The challenge affects self-image adversely; it \"shatters the mirror.\" Looking at ourselves in the pieces of broken glass we still see ourselves, but now also the stranger behind us, which makes us feel confused.  Since the stranger is us, at least he is one of us, the old-fashioned positivism becomes obsolete, and \"the facts on the ground\" begin to dominate highbrow theories. Moral contentions are now a part of life and only practice brings resolution, and resolution it must bring because the stranger we see is imaginary, contaminated by cosmopolitanism, and struggling to sort out whose culture it is he is following. In this struggle, the \"counter-cosmopolitans\" are still present but they are losing the day, thanks to the \"kindness of strangers.\"		Cosmopolitanism is truly one of the \"issues of our time.\"  I learned so much from this book, and want you to do the same as well.

"10.2307/41472361","Cosmopolitanism","039332933X","Cosmopolitanism addresses some of the host of questions that arise from our living together on the same small planet with a diverse range of cultures and peoples, whose practices and values differ, sometimes radically, from our own.  When individuals and cultures clash on questions of how to act and what is important, it can seem impossible to adjudicate between them without simply taking sides.  This is especially true when it becomes clear that both sides make sense, at least on their own terms, given the history and context out of which they arose.		Appiah uses examples drawn from his own experience growing up in Ghana, and brings to bear ideas drawn from a range of sources, in an attempt to carve out a middle ground between \"dogmatic universalism\" (the view that there is one right way to live and other ways are wrong) and \"skeptical relativism\" (that suggests anything goes and every worldview and set of practices is as right, or wrongheaded, as any other).  One attractive possibility is to find at least common grounds for adjudicating disputes, under the assumption that where we can't agree regarding the ultimate values that inform our actions we might be able to agree to accept a common tribunal.  This agreement to accept a \"higher power\" that adjudicates disputes can be rooted in the Hobbesian motive of self-preservation: i.e. we might see that it is in our interest to submit to the decisions of governing bodies because otherwise we are likely to kill each other.  But if that was all there were, there would be no reason for a stronger people or nation to accept the rulings of these bodies when they have the power to overcome disputes by force.		The argument here is that there needs to be something more than self-interest motivating our agreement to disagree peaceably, and to find ways of adjudicating disputes without resorting to violence.  This \"something more\" is what Appiah calls \"cosmopolitanism\" - a kind of attitude of respect for and interest in differences.  It involves, as he sees it, an extension of sympathies from the local to the global, but always in particular ways.  I can never know enough to care about everyone except in the most abstract and general way, but knowing enough about some culture other than my own to appreciate their ways and see them on their own terms, can help at least to minimize the strangeness of other cultures I have so far not understood.  That only sets the stage for solutions to the really hard problems that arise when these others engage in practices I find detestable or that impact me directly.  Still, cosmopolitan values make it more likely that we will support institutions that help us to resolve such problems collaboratively, through dialogue, by appealing to ideas and values and practices implicit in the opposing worldviews, and by being open to the possibility that we are the ones who might need to adjust our expectations and actions.		Obviously, this attitude of fellow feeling with strangers is only a starting point; care on a local level is always care for individuals, but I can only care about anonymous others in a very generic way.  In some cases it can do not much more than compel a weak sense that \"something ought to be done\" about the needs of others who I don't have a connection with.  I think there might need to be something stronger, and there may be something stronger than the extension of local care beyond the local.  Part of what binds us together in community at a local level is the kind of care he describes as the heart of cosmopolitanism; but what brings us together in the first place is something stronger than care, the drive that the Greeks called eros.  We are not just obliged to take care of each other given that we depend upon one another, but we also want to be together, we are driven to come together, both to procreate and to collaborate in the creation of communities and institutions and culture.  Eros is a creative drive, but one that can only be realized through collaboration with diversely situated partners.  Part of what drives the cosmopolitan, part of what motivates exploration of unfamiliar worlds and motivates the desire to initiate oneself into unfamiliar ways, is this creative drive.  The intriguing thing, though is that \"eros\" as I'm describing it is not something that can be anonymously extended like care can be extended into a sense of general respect.  This creative drive, that urges me to connect with others who are different and find and create new ways of being together, can't really be the basis of ethics.  It is not something I \"ought\" to do, as I \"ought\" to care about the suffering of others, but is always born of a kind of excitement and longing.  As I read his book, a side of cosmopolitanism that I think Appiah does not emphasize sufficiently is the importance of finding ways to foster the cross-fertilization between cultures that doesn't just lead to mutual understanding and care in spite of differences in traditions, but also creates new ways of being together that are unanticipated in the traditions that were formed apart."

"10.2307/41472361","Cosmopolitanism","039332933X","appiah's cosmopolitan is pretty much who used to be called `a citizen of the world', the traveler who is at home wherever she finds herself, maintaining an openness to the different culture and place while readily sharing knowledge of her own place and culture with people of the land she is visiting.		kwame anthony appiah transcends race and culture in what is at heart a cosmopolitan biography.  born in great britian, the son of a biracial, bicultural couple, appiah was raised in the assante city of kumasi in ghana.  appiah discusses kumasi with a familiarity which a listener would expect from someone speaking of paris, new york city, singapore or prague.  by centering himself and the city where he came of age freely into the conversation,  he is `...urging that we should learn about people in other places, take an interest in their civilizations, their arguments, their errors, their achievements, not because that will bring us to agreement, but because it will help us get used to one another'.  there are ethical reasons why we should get to used to one another defined by him as the two ideals of cosmopolitanism.		the two ideals of cosmopolitanism are 1) `universal concern, the idea that we have obligations to others, that stretch beyond those to whom we are related or of a shared citizenship, and 2) a respect for legitimate difference, that we take seriously the value not just of human life but of particular human lives, which means taking an interest in the practices and beliefs that lend them significance'.		although this is an ethical inquiry about values, appiah's style, containing familiar models and arguments over a range of far reaching topics, is accessible to the general reader.  emphasizing the importance of conversation with strangers within our land as well as abroad, appiah writes `Conversation doesn't have to lead to consensus about anything, especially not values; it's enough that it helps people get used to one another.'"
"10.2307/41472361","Cosmopolitanism","039332933X","I have to say I find Appiah's cosmopolitanism to be incredibly appealing. Call me a globalized liberal who thinks we can work most things out, but the fact that besides a bedrock belief in toleration of all but intolerance, there is little else that exists as a absolute in Appiah's thinking is attractive to me.		Appiah (like me, I'd say) is not interested in all encompassing theories. But he is also wary of an all out relativism. Appiah seems to be trying to walk a line somewhere in the middle. He argues that through engagement, \"contamination\" and tolerance we can create a new ethics what exactly this means in practical application isn't always clear, and this small book doesn't answer all the questions I have, but it's a start. And an excellent jumping off point for the kind of thinking we need to be doing in today's age."

"10.2307/41472361","Cosmopolitanism","039332933X","Laplace was explaining his sidereal equations to Napoleon. \"Do you have an equation for God?\" - the Emperor asked (hoping maybe for equivalent equations to legitimize his power). \"I have no need for such a hypothesis\", was Laplace's tart reply.		Do we need a theory of cosmopolitanism? It is a pity the author did not address this question, before rushing into its development. For indeed, the fundamental question is: do we need one? Of course, there will be no dearth of those who'll argue that without \"absolutes\" (theirs, of course) humanity is doomed. Now more than ever: as numbers increase, we risk getting on each other's nerves - the clash of civilizations, you know.		The genius of Darwin was to dispense with the idea that \"intelligent design\" was at all necessary for the evolution of living nature. The bets are that he was right. The next step would be to dispense with the idea that an \"intelligent ethical design\" is necessary at all. Professor APPIAH, whose life and experience straddles continents, would have been well placed to dare utter the unmentionable - that we do not need a \"universal ethics\" - we manage to get along with simple, local rules, thank you very much - or plain common sense.		Take one of the mainstays of armchair arguments about humanity. Selfish humanity is the prisoner of prisoner's dilemma. Unless common and compulsory rules are designed and enforced we'll be faced with the tragedy of the commons. Based on such a glorious insight a famous demographer argued in 1968 for a global and compulsory, enforceable agreement on population control. Had he done a reality check instead, he would have noticed that educated women in the West were taking the matter into their hands. No agreement was necessary - millions of diverse minds in infinitely diverse circumstances somehow zeroed in on a convergent solution. And indeed, this is what is happening now worldwide today - except where intelligent moral design or conflict is interfering with it.		It all goes back to the \"absolutist\" view that humans are essentially identical dummies, clad in fancy but contingent garb. Men are selfish - period. Men are totally corrupted by sin - pass the port, will you? The world outside, thank you, is everything but essentialist. Diversity is the name of the game, so general rules are difficult to derive, even more difficult to enforce. On the other hand if you let diversity play out long enough, accommodation will ensue. There is no high road, signposts and all, just infinite path-dependent outcomes like those that led her mother to declare Kumasi her \"home\", and his father to be a British barrister.		Based on such grains of reality, had he asked cultural anthropologists like Leach or Geertz, they would have explained that plasticity and pragmatism within traditional societies - rather than contamination from without - is what makes their classification so difficult. Do I hear some distant whimsical giggles coming from Western Samoa?		Studying humanity as it adapts (or maldapts) would be, in my view far more fruitful than putting it on the Procustes bed of theory and a priori thinking. Of course, it all comes with a price: we cannot make predictions. We are not *assured\" the outcome beforehand, even though, as anyone who dabbles in history knows, this is pure delusion.		Speculating whether surreptitiously killing a mandarin in China to enrich oneself is morally justified or not (pg. 155) is just idle thought. The author lifts this question from Balzac - but misses the obvious cue in the text: the person to whom the question is directed answers with a joke. A frivolous question only deserves a frivolous answer.		Having chosen to engage in theory, this text is a tortuous intellectual canter at the edge of reality, skillfully avoiding any reality check of most concepts and abstractions that are introduced. So large looms the preoccupation with the \"ought to\" that any enquiry into \"what is\" or \"what do we actually do\" is ignored. At the end the ride looks no more than the rocking gently on a wooden horse in the merry-go-round: pleasant, but in the end circular.		The author ought to have stuck to consequentialism. Experience uncovers consequences. Experience is transformative - so all ex ante armchair speculation is vacuous. Our use of \"values\" shows that each one of us is seldom consequent about values - even less so about their ranking. Circumstances sway us, and then we construct rationalizations after the fact. If we can draw a conclusion from our experience is that humanity is \"crooked timber\" - to use Kant's famous words. Which should come to no surprise, the whole of nature has the same feel about bit.		Yet, looking back at the history of our last 10'000 years we can detect some form of progress - the accumulation of experience seems to have taught us some lessons. Famines, disease and poverty are receding, slavery is on the wane, and the role of women is better accepted. We have waged wars, persecuted, and even created holocausts along the way. But at the end of the day we seem to be adjusting to a cosmopolitan way of life - even without a cosmopolitan ethic to guide us into it. Such an ethic might just be the result, rather than the precondition, of complexification.		Of course, \"past performance is no guarantee of future results\" - and one may still be tempted to impose \"redeeming\" values from on high to ensure the outcome. There are certainly those who are agitating in this direction, or imagining \"clashes of civilization\" unless we do so. Looking back it seems that trying to enforce conformity on our profoundly diverse species has been cause for many (I'd venture most) wars. Experience would tend to make me skeptical of any \"intelligent design of morality\". This is not a recipe for \"laisser aller\" - it is a plea for aconcentrated study of what works in accommodation, hoping that among the many recipes few can become more widespread.		Nothing is certain, and indeed, intelligent moral design (be it religious or secular in origin) may be the way to go. My skeptical mind would rather entrust the future to the study of diversity of approaches and the accumulation of experience - hoping for a cosmopolitan society at the end of the run.		Experience is the best Ockham's razor at hand. Pity the author has failed to wield it decisively, adding irrelevancies like witchcraft and taboos instead. Though our mind invents such constructs every day, the slow working of experience wears them away continuously."

"10.2307/41472361","Cosmopolitanism","039332933X","There is, so far, no better or more mature book on moral cosmopolitanism than Appiah's Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers. In it, Appiah makes plain, by well-crafted appeals to the reader's good sense that are replete with ethnographic examples and real-world insights, what romantics and theologians have been telling us for ages: There is but a hair's breadth of difference between us; a tiny space that we can fill with causes for consternation and hatred, or with salutary joy at considering that difference. This Appiah does without in any way suggesting that there can ever be an end to the moral and cultural tensions that those differences do and must invite. He sketches the tenable cosmopolitanism we have been waiting for, and he parts company with the sentimentalist versions that remain - and should remain - in the shallow end of the pool.		Appiah, here as elsewhere (The Ethics of Identity), marvels that so many intellectuals have distorted the truth about the key insights of cosmopolitans, and he takes them to task. These have argued that cosmopolitanism contains an incredible and/or dangerous set of normative proposals and disregards the \"facts\" of human nature (that we are an insular species, with a territoriality that is red in tooth and claw). Appiah deftly replies that it is the cultural conservative, the jejune jingoist or nationalist, the duped hyper-contextualist, whose view of the world and of human nature is distorted, for the history of human social, cultural and even sexual intercourse is replete with cross-pollinations of language, religion, art, dress, rites, metaphysical outlooks, and progeny, all bespeaking an enormous aptitude for cooperation, bonding and friendship. We are an inter-cultural, intertwined, and interdependent species, just like every other on the planet. The view of ourselves as culturally isolated is the view that bears the burden of proof. It is, in fact, demonstrably false.		Appiah laments that so many philosophers and intellectuals, adopting a bad historicism, have argued, falsely, that we humans can only see the world up to the point of our own contextual \"walls.\" He joins many - George Lakoff, Martha Nussbaum, William Sloane Coffin, Mohandis K. Gandhi, R.W. Emerson - in arguing that the greater truth of our humanity is our ability to imaginatively think new thoughts, to reconsider plans of life, to fashion new worlds of possibility, while acknowledging that each of us has a home that we should cherish, improve, perfect, and defend.		However, I in turn lament that this volume has failed to address what continues to go missing in normative literature - the role of love in moral imagination. For it seems to me that it is love - a word we are so often afraid to use in our secular and public discourse - that has the most power to make proper use of that hair's breadth of difference that we often find so important, that we are so ready to murder and maim for - where we, sometimes and lamentably, lend credence to those who would see us as best understood as having natures that are red in tooth and claw. I would like Professor Appiah to consider this a challenge, a challenge to write one more book to overcome what I perceive as this volume's single, but important, failing. I make this challenge because, once this failing is remedied, his body of work will have provided us with a full circle of mature cosmopolitan thought in the contemporary world."
"10.2307/41472361","Cosmopolitanism","039332933X","One of the most pernicious ideas has spung from the myth that we are necessarily separated and segregated into groups that are defined by criteria like gender, language, race, religion or some other kind of boundary. And it is easy to see that these boundaries are a major cause of conflict.		The author of this enthralling book - Kwame Anthony Appiah - challenges this kind of separative thinking by resurrecting the ancient philosophy of \"cosmopolitanism.\" This school of thought that dates back almost 2500 years to the Cynics of Ancient Greece. They first articulated the cosmopolitan ideal that all human beings were citizens of the world. Later on, these ideas were elaborated by another group of philosophers: the Stoics.		According to Appiah, the influence of cosmopolitanism has stretched down the ages and through to the Enlightenment. He takes Immanuel Kant's notion of a League of Nations and the Declaration of the Rights of Man to be two manifestations of this ancient idea.		Appiah sees cosmopolitanism as a dynamic concept based on two fundamental ideas. First is the idea that we have responsibilities to others that are beyond those based on kinship or citizenship. Second is something often forgotten: just because other people have different customs and beliefs from ours, they will likely still have meaning and value. We may not agree with someone else, but mutual understanding should be a first goal.		The book is full of personal experiences. I doubt that anyone else could have written it: His mother was an English author and daughter of the statesman Sir Stafford Cripps, and his father a Ghanaian barrister and politician, who reminded his children to remember that they were \"citizens of the world.\"		Appiah was educated in Ghana and England and has taught in both countries. He now holds a chair of Philosophy at Princeton. He  is no starry eyed idealist, and he knows that differences between groups and nations cannot be wished away or ignored. But he contends, rightly, I think, that differences can be accepted without being allowed to become barriers.		As he says, \"Cosmopolitans suppose that all cultures have enough overlap in their vocabulary of values to begin a conversation. But they don't suppose, like some Universalists, that we could all come to agreement if only we had the same vocabulary.\" The reason is simply this: most of us arrive at our values not on the basis of careful reasoning, but by lifelong conditioning and subjective beliefs and attitudes.		In parts of Europe, there have recently been misgivings about the growing diversity and multiculturalism of countries like the United Kingdom, with people asking whether it is doing no more than fracturing society. Appiah tackles this question head on. He has this to say, \"If we want to preserve a wide range of human conditions because it allows free people the best chance to make their own lives, there is no place for the enforcement of diversity by trapping people within a kind of difference that they long to escape. There simply is no decent way to sustain those communities of difference that will not survive without the free allegiance of their members.\"		Cosmopolitanism, balances our \"obligations to others\" with the \"value not just of human life but of particular human lives,\" what Appiah calls \"universality plus difference.\" He remains skeptical about simple maxims for ethical behavior such as the Golden Rule. He swiftly demonstrates its failings as a moral precept. He argues that cosmopolitanism is the name not \"of the solution but of the challenge.\"		This is an important book that will inevitably be controversial. In a world that is becoming more interconnected and shrinking by the day, and where the \"clash of cultures\" threatens our existence, Appiah has many new perspectives as he articulates a precise yet flexible ethical manifesto. He does not claim to have all the answers, but this book should be of interest to all of us as we try to make sense of the turmoil, challenges and opportunities of our globalizing world."
"10.2307/41472361","Cosmopolitanism","039332933X","Appiah has written an intelligent, urbane, and concise analysis of, and prescription for, the global world we have come to inhabit. His title \"Cosmopolitan\" is intended to evoke its etymology, that we are \"citizens of the world.\" Unlike Robert Wright in \"The Moral Animal,\" Appiah rejects a one-world government, insisting we need to maintain a pluralistic system of governments for the ostensible purpose of creative enhancements, e.g., changes to the existent models through new insights, programs, and trial-and-error (hopefully, with errors corrected).		This book tackles some of the ethical issues involved as the global perspective is taking shape. Most of his prescriptions are pragmatic (Chap. 4: \"Primacy of Practice\"), rather than doctrinaire, evidenced most clearly in his chapter on pluralistic cultures and how best to \"manage\" their differences (Chap. 8: \"Whose Culture Is It, Anyway?\"). He clearly disdains the positivist approach (\"Escape from Positivism\"), yet in spite of this disdain, he keeps to the empirical side of most questions (Chap. 3: \"Evidence on the Ground\"). Aristotlean common-sense is offered where it's needed.		That we are all neighbors should by now be obvious (Chap. 5: \"Imaginary Strangers\" and passim), and while capitalism is accepted, not without its fetters. Islamic and Christian fundamentalism are reproved appropriately (Chap. 9: \"The Counter-Cosmopolitans\"), while the Anglican-type of latitudinarianism is espoused (without the religious particulars). \"Pluralism\" is our global credo, to which I heartily reply, \"Amen.\" I often wish we recognized it as our national credo as well.		He forthrightly repudiates Singer's and Unger's utilitarian \"moral calculi,\" and extols a person-centered ethic in their stead. He also insists that the \"stranger\" is no longer an alien, and we still need to heed the New Testament's advice (Rom. 12:11: \"Contribute to the needs of the saints, extend hospitality to strangers\"). Indeed, we all come \"at\" our situations with different assumptions and histories, and, with some obvious exceptions, we owe each other respect as we \"converse\" in hopes of appreciating our differences and understanding our common ground.		Multiculturalism, besides being incoherent, is not the solution, because \"original cultures\" are a myth, and not all cultures are \"equal.\" He takes issue with cultural \"contamination\" and its typical reaction of \"disgust,\" offering examples of inappropriate stigmitization (e.g., homosexuality, unusual religious beliefs, etc.). Only when we recognize each other as \"fellow citizens,\" and respect everyone enough to engage them seriously, then we're on the course to mutual respect, pluralistic tolerance, and genuine concern. And the Golden Rule, while not perfect, isn't a bad place to start. Ultimately, there is no \"us\" vs. \"them,\" for we're all citizens of the same world."
"10.2307/41472361","Cosmopolitanism","039332933X","In this short, brilliantly written book, Princeton philosophy professor Kwame Anthony Appiah attempts to articulate an ethical theory that applies to our current age of globalization.  Taking  as his starting point the writings of Diogenes, the 4th century Greek Cynic philosopher, Appiah develops a philosophy of cosmopolitanism modeled on Diogenes' \"citizen of the world.\"  A citizen of the world regards the individual rather than family, tribe, or nation as the primary focus of ethical agency.  And that it is important to recognize that individuals are bound by belief systems and cultures that are not only different but may also be opposed to their own.  Cosmopolitanism is an ethics somewhere between relativism and universalism that can build a working relationship between adherents of different belief systems enabling coexistance but not necessarily agreement.		This is not as easy as it sounds; in fact, it doesn't even sound easy.  Cosmopolitanism is, in addition to Diogenes legacy, a product of the Enlightenment in that it celebrates diversity and multiculturalism; it is tolerant of diverse moralities.  However, it is intolerant of those who would deny tolerance of this diversity or plurality.  This is the central dilemma of cosmopolitanism.  It attempts to reconcile liberal universal values with the values of those who disagree with them.  Cosmopolitanism believes in the basic freedoms, including freedom of speech but it will curb any speech that calls for restricting that freedom.		This dilemma is currently playing itself out worldwide with the publication in a Danish newspaper cartoons depicting Mohammed.  Denmark is a quintessential liberal country and regards mocking belief systems as a basic human right.  On the other hand, for Muslim fundamentalists the content of the cartoons roils beliefs that they live and die for.  Other European countries expressed solidarity with the Danes, reaffirming their rights to freedom of speech.  Likewise, Muslim extremists worldwide are rioting and calling it blasphemy.		Appiah is, of course, a product of Western schooling, so his position is probably more on the side of the Danes. (I'm assuming since this book was written before the incident.)  Appiah's cosmpolitanism stands for enlightened liberal values, but with a difference.  He recognizes that Muslim fundamentalism is a challenge to cosmopolitanism - he calls them counter-cosmopolitans - because it too is a morality, a universal one.  However, Muslim fundamentalism is not a tolerant universalism.  Appiah's cosmopolitanism believes in universal truth as well, \"though we are less certain we already have all of it.\"  This is not skepticism nor is it relativism, it is a more humble relationship with universal truth.  Cosmopolitans believe that there are many values worth living for, its just that we cannot live for all of them, but we can live alongside them.		And how will the cartoon drama play itself out?  My guess is that the Muslim fundamentalists will not back down, for them it is blasphemy pure and simple.  The Danes, being secular, tolerant, and inclined towards cosmopolitanism, will recognize that freedom of speech is an excercise in self-restraint.  They will have learned that the cartoons genuinely offended a certain group of people, and, as a consequence, they will apologize, but without abandoning their values. This illustrates another aspect of cosmopolitanism known as fallibilism.  They know that knowledge is at best imperfect and is subject to change in the light of new understanding.  The Danes will have learned something from this incident because cosmopolitanism is a open-ended system, the Muslim fundamentalists, on the other hand, will have learned  nothing beyond what they already know.		\"Cosmopolitans don't insist that everyone become cosmopolitan.  They know they don't have all the answers.  They're humble enough to think that they might learn from strangers; not too humble to think that strangers can't learn from them.\""
"10.2307/41472361","Cosmopolitanism","039332933X","In my opinion this book deserves considerably less acclaim than it appears to have received.  As a modest call for understanding among cultural groups, who could disagree?  Appiah, however, himself a product of two contrasting cultures, here takes on a more daunting task: reconciling his respect for the cultures of both his African father and English mother, but the result is a rather incoherent narrative, especially in chapters 2 and 3.  This is perhaps best demonstrated by two statements that appear on p-42.  In defense of his paternal culture, he first writes \"There is nothing unreasonable, then, about my kinsmen's belief in witchcraft.\"  His word \"then\" is a reflection of his claim, made on the previous pages, that the \"Duhem thesis\" allows him to argue that all attempts to grasp reality are culturally conditioned and can therefore be regarded as \"valid\" within the cultures in which they arise.  However, this claim seriously misconstrues the Duhem thesis, with Appiah's arguments reflecting the postmodernist thinking of the \"science wars\" era of some 30 years ago that is now largely discredited.  But then comes his second statement as his mother's culture comes to the fore: \"What's wrong with the theory of witchcraft is not that it doesn't make sense but that it isn't true.\"  In these two statements one can see the tension in Appiah's struggle to reconcile his bicultural upbringing.  That his Asante father really believes he is communicating with his ancestors when he  pours  whiskey on the floor (p-34) may be interesting, but that is hardly a convincing alternative to the scientific worldview of his maternal forebearers.		Another problem is Appiah's seeming unawareness that \"culture\" can be a literal prison for a sensitive person raised within it.  In defense of what used to be called \"female genital mutilation\" he here (p-73) tells African women that the operation can be regarded as \"an expression of your cultural identity.\"  Try telling that to Hirsi Ali, whose efforts to free herself, at considerable personal risk, of the bonds of a very similar cultural background after having received such a \"cultural identity\" mark has attracted worldwide attention.  Also unmentioned by him is any recognition that over the span of human history it has often been precisely those who found the courage to think and act in opposition to their cultural heritage who became some of humanities greatest benefactors.  When confronted by epilepsy Jesus saw only a boy possessed by demons, but 400 years earlier while discussing that same disease Hippocrates mocked his cultural compatriots and their demon-haunted world by claiming that epilepsy was nothing more than the result of natural causes, and he thereby laid the foundations for the long journey that culminated in the benefits of modern medicine.  Appiah's primary motivation seems to be a desire to step on no one's toes, but his efforts are unconvincing, and he might well have considered these comments of Edward Grant, a major figure in understanding the history of science.  While speaking of the cultural backwardness of medieval Europe when faced by the superior cultures of the Middle East, Grant wrote:		\"Latin scholars in the 12th century recognized that not all cultures are equal. They were painfully aware that with respect to science and natural philosophy, their civilization was manifestly inferior to that of Islam. They faced an obvious choice: learn from their superiors or remain inferior forever. They chose to learn. Had they assumed that all cultures were equal . . . they would have had no reason to seek out Arab learning and the glorious scientific legacy that followed would not have occurred.\"		Well said, even though Appiah provides little evidence of grasping the significance of such a perspective."
"10.2307/41472361","Cosmopolitanism","039332933X","There are few individuals more qualified to write a book on the idea of cosmopolitanism than Kwame Anthony Appiah.  Biracial, raised in both Ghana and England, multicultural, multilingual, educated at Cambridge but teaching at Princeton, Appiah has an inside familiarity with larger world that few can rival.  It is tremendously encouraging to me, a WASP who has been unable to engage in any real travel, that we both seem to share precisely the same ideals.  My experience of the world counts for little; his a great deal.  Yet it shows that people with extremely different backgrounds can embrace the same ideals.		Appiah is a philosopher, but though he has clearly been raised in the Anglo-American linguistic philosophical tradition, he has not found himself restricted by it.  From the various philosophers he quotes, I'm sure that he and had had similar philosophical training.  I envy the way that he can make what I learned as logical positivism (Appiah lops off the \"logical\") and make it relevant in a discussion of wider cultural issues.  Though he obviously was trained in the tradition honed by Russell, Carnap, Frege, Ryle, Austin, Anscombe, Dummett, and the large contingent of American and British logicians and philosophers of language, none of them have informed his literary style.  In fact, the two writers Appiah reminds me of most are Herodotus and Montaigne.  Like them, he feels a license to bring into his discussion almost anything.  If he is cosmopolitan on a moral and social level, he is also as a multidisciplinarian.  Nor does he hesitate at mixing cultures.  Many of the most compelling passages in the book detail incidents from his experience in Ghana.		The point of the book is to discuss many of the problems that arise if one attempts to embrace--as Appiah clearly feels we all should--cosmopolitan ideals.  He deals interestingly with a host of issues, from the idea of who owns the products of a culture to the incommensurability of values from one culture to another (or their possible commensurability) to whether it is problematic when there are conflicts on fundamental issues.  As a person he seems to have been deeply molded by all of the cultural influences in which he grew up, but as a philosopher he is exceptionally British.  Over the decades there have been a number of British thinkers who have been able to cut through a thick wad of nonsense and discuss issues in a balanced, commonsensical manner.  Gilbert Ryle had this capacity, as did (sometimes) G. E. Moore, and so also Mary Midgley.  While his views are unquestionably progressive, Appiah always seems to avoid extremes to arrive at conclusions that are, above all else, balanced and reasonable.  He is a master at making sense.  So when philosopher Peter Unger argues that we all have a moral obligation to give every penny that we do not need for our own sustenance to organizations like UNICEF and OXFAM so that food and medicine can be purchased for the desperately poor in the Third World.  Appiah, on the other hand, believes that a world in which no one bought a ticket to the opera would be flat and uninteresting.  Besides, what really matters is reforming local governments in order to provide long-term transformation of the socioeconomic structures in the areas most afflicted by poverty, something that giving exclusively to UNICEF and OXFAM will not accomplish (though for the record, Appiah thinks both organizations are very important and he does not discourage contributing to them).  Though he does not state it as a principle, he constantly employs something akin to Aristotle's golden mean.		I especially enjoyed his chapter on The Counter-Cosmopolitans.  He places many of today's Islamic extremists in this category, though he also very correctly places many Christian fundamentalists here as well.  I have long fantasized about writing a book about contemporary proponents of Counter-Enlightenment ideas (a book I will never write because I haven't mastered the range of disciplines such a project would require).  Isaiah Berlin wrote frequently about various Counter-Enlightenment thinkers such as Hamaan, but I believe it can be extended into the present for such mass movements as various religious fundamentalisms (Christian, Islamic, as well as Jewish), the New Age movement, contemporary astrology, right wing political movements, and free market capitalism.  Obviously I can't make my claim here, but I found Appiah's discussion of the counter-cosmopolitans to overlap entirely with counter-enlightenment ideals.		I value this book not only for its ideals and the intelligent discussion of a host of thorny issues, but for Appiah's warm humanity and wonderful literary style.  It is not merely an intelligent book but a well-written one as well."
"10.2307/41472361","Cosmopolitanism","039332933X","We can move to a better neighborhood or to a different country.  But all humanity is our neighbor, like them or not.		Mr. Appiah, the renowned Princeton philosophy professor, challenges us with the paradox of a common humanity, among which, different ethnic and religious groups often do not share customs, or even the same values.  The Cosmopolitan thesis is that, despite being strangers in many ways, our common humanity provides a basis for mutual respect and compassion.		What anchors the paradox at one end is that, for most of human history, we knew only our own kind, with limited need to understand, let alone to accept, the customs of people in other groups.  Over the last few centuries, increased trade and communication, as well as industrial pollution and international terrorism, has changed framework.  Since our actions can affect \"lives everywhere,\" ethical living implies responsibilities beyond our immediate environment and social group.  Humanity has become, in a sense, one \"tribe.\"		Mr. Appiah reminds us that the view of being a citizen of the world reflects intellectual traditions at least as old as classical times; that Marcus Aurelius, whose works were attractive to many Christian intellectuals, himself sought to suppress Christianity; that, then again, Christianity, whose allegiances have often fueled persecution, originally spread from Paul's assertion of \"neither Jew nor Greek . . . . for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.\"  Yet, Mr. Appiah also reminds us, respect for those different includes respect for their freedom to be separate, as in the case of the Amish in the United States.		If you find yourself often straddling the same paradox and long to find a partner in the journey, you will find one in Mr. Appiah's short (196 pp.), varied, and challenging book.  He provides examples of agreeing, yet agreeing to disagree.  The non-Muslim for example, would agree on the devout's right to make a hajj to Mecca, but may not agree that a Deity has commanded it, or that avoiding pork is appropriate.  The paradox is exemplified in explanations of the natural world.  Even an agreement on facts leaves ambiguity in theories; e.g., whether it is germs or (many tiny) spirits that cause disease.  Mr. Appiah makes a case that there are even fewer compelling arguments based on fact in the determination of values.  The journey continues to the Ghana of the author's father, where we find out about \"taboos\" dealing with bush meat and menstruating women.  A distinction made here is that, while taboos separate peoples, or classes within peoples (rulers, nobles, and slaves), morals differ in that they guide us in the treatment of others, so a taboo is a distinction with less of a difference.  Even so, taboos are common to all cultures; westerners eat pigs but not cats.		A cosmopolitan understands and can live with difference, even when the differences are mutually understood.  A \"universalist,\" on the other hand, expects agreement through understanding.  Mr. Appiah has us step back from taboos, to the more engaging questions of values.  Still, while most people in a society value fair punishment, not all agree that punishment is worth the risk of punishing the innocent; while men in different societies relate their honor to the chastity of related women, not all of these men would agree that honor compels killing a woman who is raped.  We find that reasoned argument does not compel either of these positions to those taking them.  There seems to be a sort of getting \"used to,\" that even a great mathematician (von Neumann) would endorse as reason's companion.		Mr. Appiah's treads lightly across serious subjects, and perhaps that is a cosmopolitan virtue.  He contends that strangers are beyond communication mainly when they are imaginary; that is, when they are people we have not met one-to-one.  Also, that, among diversity, there are inevitable commonalities:  \"I have failed to get people interested in Zeno's paradox in three continents.\"  That, when caring about others requires an \"out-group,\" one's caring is perhaps mere self-comfort.		Mr. Appiah explores the concept of cultural preservation.  He proposes a difference between preserving culture and preserving cultures.  He challenges the idea of \"authenticity,\" as limited by the facts of history, such as the role of trade in the development of kente cloth and bagpipes.  The need to \"preserve\" is argued as an ignorance of how free non-Westerners are to interpret American TV and consumer products.  At worst, an attitude of cultural preservation condescends.  We learn that the ancients saw the value of \"contamination\":  stoic teachers traveling between city states, an African-born playwright, Publius Terentius Afer, using Greek ideas in Roman drama.  We are offered, quoting this playright, a golden rule:  \"I am human: nothing is alien to me.\"		We are given a glimpse of the founder of the scouting movement, collecting (or looting?), as a prelude to a discussion of cultural objects.  Mr. Appiah takes us to the question of whether a Norse goblet is more valuable in a Spanish museum or in a Norwegian family's living room.  Cosmopolitanism proposes that the connection through ethnic identity across centuries is no less real than the connection through a common humanity.		Mr. Appiah includes some discussion of counter-cosmopolitans, for example, Islamic fundamentalists, to help us understand by way of contrast.  The universal aspect in this case, and in others, is one that looks beyond borders or ethnicity, and excludes those who disbelieve.  This discussion evokes the cosmopolitan understanding that different people will have different values, and that this is quite acceptable (with some exception for values not worth having).  The cosmopolitan knows that one can learn from those with whom one disagrees.  The counter-cosmopolitan sees nothing to be gained by reaching out from the faithful.		Finally, we are given the author's reflection on questions of sacrifice for the benefit of others.  So, how much would we sacrifice to save the life of a child in a foreign country with nutrition and medicine?  One hundred dollars?  If that much, why not more - say, another hundred dollars.  Or is there a point when it's more important to go the opera?  And - is it really possible to save another's life for more than a few days, given the harsh realities of their life situation.  Is it as easy as deciding to ruin a suit in order to save a child from drowning, and why?  What is the principle behind the answers to these questions, if there is one.		The journey continues:  Mr. Appiah provides an informative and provocative guide to how to treat strangers, meant of course, in the large.  I do not guarantee the reader will find comfortable answers, only insights and surprising information, and that your answers, which are how you actually live, will now have questions to challenge them."
"10.2307/41472361","Cosmopolitanism","039332933X","Appiah (the Laurence S Rockefeller Professor of Philosophy and the Center for Human Values at Princeton University)writes in an urbane introduction to the issues multiculturalism poses for our society and should be must reading for all those who want to really understand the complexity of our new century. After reading this book we might all be able to agree (to paraphrase what someone famously said about Keynes) that we are all cosmopolitian (ists) now. No one can truly escape into their own monocultural island --our cities, our media and most important our language and culture are infused with layer upon layer of global cultures whether we are aware of them or not. Appiah begins by examining the root meanings of cosmopolitianism--		\"A citizen--a polites--belonged to a particular polis, a city to which he or she owed loyalty. The cosmos referred to the world, not in the sense of the earth but in the sense of the universe. Talk of cosmopolitianism originally signaled, then a rejection of the conventional view that every civilized person belonged to a community among communities.\"		Appiah's easy non academic style helps you understand the role of the Enlightenment thinkers such as Wieland--(once called the German Voltaire Appiah adds) who wrote	\"Cosmopolitans..regard all the people of the earth as so many branches of a single family, and the universe as a state, of which they, with innumerable other than rational beings, are citizens, are citizens, promoting together under the general laws of nature the perfection of the whole, while each in his own fashion is busy about his own well-being.\"		Appiah's learning is worn lightly as he answers the all important question --what does it mean to hold the view that we are citizens of the world? What happens to local allegiances--for Virginia Woolf it meant--\"freedom from unreal loyalties\" and Leo Tolstoy wrote about the \"stupidity of patriotism\"--on the opposite side of the equation are people like Hitler and Stalin who are deep foes of cosmpolitianism and we all know how that ended up. Appiah's huge store of reading helps him navigate through the issue of loyalties which lies at the heart of the question. George Eliot's creation of Daniel Deronda-the very English gentleman who discovers his Jewish heritage only as an adult--explains his interest in studying his heritage in these terms, \"I want to be an Englishman, but I want to understand other points of view. And I want to get rid of the a merely English attitude in studies.\"		The issue comes down to self definition and how we claim it--we have to be open to the idea that our cultural background creates a way we can connect with others--Eliot talks of the \"closer fellowship that makes sympathy practical.\"		And this is just the introduction! The cluster of questions Appiah considers are truly wide ranging -but often remain invisible in debate--questions such \"as what we owe strangers by virtue of our shared humanity?, can culture be \"owned\" ?	As a philosopher he can be skilled with applying some important distinctions--so for example when we talk about objective values we are really talking about desired values --some of which depend on certain facts--he gives the example of universal vaccination as being a value --but we are often prepared to give this value up when the disease has been eliminated. Where we often go astray Appiah argues is where we view an individual's moral vocabulary as belonging to one individual--all the important values-such as kindness, cruelty are public and shared across cultures. It is first and foremost evaluative language we are using--a way of communicating to each other our preferences--if your values were not shared in language --there would be no way we could refer to them. The reason why values are important in our society is that they allow us to get things done together--we appeal to those values in order to act in the public forum--whether it is building a road, going to the moon, or making peace. Our stories that we share embody our values and certain stories are more important than others in our national culture because they enshrine some key values. So one of the purposes of studying a foreign language and reading books in translation is to appreciate the nuances of other people's values.		Not all chapters are discursive essays--some are personal meditations based on growing up in Ghana and the ways that the culture and beliefs shape someone so that conversation sometimes becomes problematic. The author gives the example of medicine and how the conversation between someone who believes in witchcraft to accept the findings of modern medicine. Why should they believe in viruses--that you cannot see? Just because you said so? You can say that you can predict who can get well but not who will get sick. In the end you have to appeal to a community of people who can test the evidence that goes beyond the anectdotal and subjective.		There are insights all along the way--for example the independence movements in Africa and elsewhere that brought to an end colonial rule were arguments about values--not African values per se --but values embodied in the rhetoric that had	guided the Allies in their conflict with the Axis powers--\"It was a conflict of interests couched in terms of the same values.\"		Important points are made about so called cultural purity and cultural contamination--we see so many examples of ethnic communities within hetrogeneous cultures choosing to live within their own cultural borders--but as Appiah so eloquently argues--\"cultural purity is an oxymoron\"--multiculturalism is in some shape or form in all our lives--in the Middle East, in China, in Ghana and in our own western world. The entire history of culture has been related to mixing one cultural strain with another--from the Roman through to the Alexanderian and British empires to the American century--cultures are continually reinterpreted and reinvented. Intolerance for others is bred of universalistic fundamentalist creeds whether they be Islamic or Christian or Jewish can as we know all too well lead to dangerous consequences--however as Appiah reminds us the truly toxic aspects of this are not so much in terms of those beliefs but their fear and sometimes prohibition of conversation. Without conversation they can extend their belief that \"not everyone matters\" and other equally savage ideas and not owe anyone a justification as to why. They don't want to be drawn into explaining precisely because they don't want to have to justify themselves or their beliefs to others--because they know that their values are not ultimately defensible. Reason is at the center of it all--\"come let us reason together\" should be the motto of every civilized person--it offers a ground for your thinking and my thinking.		In terms of the central question--what are our obligations to others--Appiah's answer is to be common sensical--it is to do \"our fair share\"--we cannot be required to do more. But what is our \"fair share\"? How do we deal with the fact that so many people are not doing their fair share? He discusses this and other issues--such as the paradox that one of the world's greatest capitalists is providing billions to help eradicate preventable diseases around the globe and our economic system allows the average cow to live on a $2.50 a day subsidy when 3 billion people live on less than $2 dollars a day. Appiah points out that Jeffrey Sachs has argued that we can eradicate extreme poverty for about $150 billion a year for 20 years. Clearly we can do better, as Appiah argues it is a \"demand of simple morality\" and we can also agree with him that this end might be more achievable \"if we made civilization more cosmopolitan\""
"10.2307/41472361","Cosmopolitanism","039332933X","Philosophy is hard. Approach starts with a conversational tone and many interesting stories about his family and his native Ghana. Perhaps it's easier for him to see how we should take on our responsibilities for the other people in the world because he's had to adapt to so many changes in cultures.. He discusses intellectual and artistic properties and where they rightly belong, but doesn't in any way talk about social media and how it is drawing the world closer together. I think he's interesting, but still very hard to understand."
